Quantifying Heat Energy
• The heat capacity of an object is proportional to the following:
– Its mass
– The specific heat of the material
• The quantity of heat absorbed by an object can be determined
 if the following are known:
– Mass
– Specific heat capacity
– Temperature change
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Specific Heat Capacity
• Measure of a substance’s intrinsic
ability to absorb heat.
• The specific heat capacity is the
amount of heat energy required to raise
the temperature of one gram of a
substance 1 °C.
– Cs
– Units J/(g · °C)
• The molar heat capacity is the
amount of heat energy required to
raise the temperature of one mole
of a substance 1 °C.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem:
Temperature Changes and Heat Capacity
You find a pre-1982 penny in the snow. How much heat is
absorbed as it warms from -8.0 oC to body temperature,
37.0 oC? Assume the penny is pure copper and has a mass
of 3.10 g
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Heat Transfer and Final Temperature
• When two objects at different
temperatures are placed in contact,
heat flows from the material at the
higher temperature to the material at
the lower temperature.
• Heat flows until both materials reach the
same final temperature.
• The amount of heat energy lost by the
hot material equals the amount of heat
gained by the cold material.
• If one is defined as our system, the
other as surroundings then:
qsystem=-qsurroundings
qsys = -qsurr
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Thermal Energy Transfer
A block of metal at 55 °C is added to water at
25 °C.
• Thermal energy transfers heat from the metal
to the water.
• The exact final temperature depends on
the following:
– The mass of the metal
– The mass of water
– Specific heat capacities of the metal and
of water
mmetal × Cs, metal × ΔTmetal = -mwater × Cs, water × ΔTwater
qmetal = -qwater
qmetal +qwater=0
mmetal × Cs, metal × ΔTmetal +mwater × Cs, water × ΔTwater = 0
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Thermal Energy Transfer
A 32.5 g cube of aluminum initially at 45.8 oC is submerged
into 105.3 g of water at 15.4 oC. What is the final
temperature? (Assume there is no heat lost)
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Pressure–Volume Work
• PV work is work caused by a volume change against an external
pressure.
• When gases expand, ΔV is positive, but the system is doing work on
the surroundings, so wgas is negative.
• As long as the external pressure is kept constant, w = –PΔV.
 Workgas = External Pressure × Change in Volumegas
• To convert the units to joules, use 101.3 J = 1 atm · L.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Pressure–Volume Work
To inflate a balloon you must do pressure-volume work
on the surroundings. If you inflate a balloon from a
volume of 0.100 L to 1.85L, against atmospheric
pressure (1.00 atm), how much work is done (in Joules)

Exchanging Energy between System and
Surroundings
• Exchange of heat energy
q = mass × specific heat × ΔTemperature
• Exchange of work
w = −Pressure × ΔVolume
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Measuring ΔE: Calorimetry at Constant Volume
• Because ΔE = q + w, ΔE can be determined by measuring q and w.
• In practice, it is easiest to do a process in such a way that there is no
change in volume, so w = 0.
– At constant volume, ΔEsystem = qsystem.
• In practice, temperature changes of individual chemicals involved in the
reaction cannot be observed directly, so instead the temperature change
in the surroundings is measured.
– Using an insulated container (e.g., controlled surroundings)
 qsystem = −qsurroundings
• The surrounding area is called a bomb calorimeter and is usually made
of a sealed, insulated container filled with water.
qsurroundings = qcalorimeter = –qsystem
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Bomb Calorimeter
• It is used to measure ΔE
because it is a constant
volume system.
• The heat capacity of the
calorimeter is the amount of
heat absorbed by the
calorimeter for each degree
rise in temperature and is
called the calorimeter
constant.
– Ccal, kJ/°C
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Measuring ΔErxn in a
Bomb Calorimeter
When 1.010 g of sucrose (C12H22O11) undergoes
combustion in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature
rises from 24.92 oC to 28.33 oC. Find ΔErxn for the
combustion of sucrose (in kJ/mol). The heat capacity
of the calorimeter is 4.90 kJ/oC.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Enthalpy: Heat Evolved at Constant
Pressure
• “Bomb” Calorimetry is nice but…. we would like to work at
atmospheric pressure
• For a system at e.g. atmospheric pressure the total energy is E plus
the energy required to push the gas aside to make space for the
system: PV
• The enthalpy, H, of a system is the sum of the internal energy of the
system and the product of pressure and volume.
– H is a state function.
H = E + PV
• The enthalpy change, ΔH, of a reaction is the heat evolved in a
reaction at constant pressure.
ΔHreaction = qreaction at constant pressure
• Usually ΔH and ΔE are similar in value; the difference is largest for
reactions that produce or use large quantities
of gas.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions
• When ΔH is negative, heat is being released by the system
into the surroundings.
– The surroundings will “feel” hot.
– Temperature of the surroundings increased from the energy
released by the system.
– This is called an exothermic reaction.
• When ΔH is positive, heat is being absorbed by the system
from the surroundings.
– The surroundings will “feel” cold.
• Temperature of the surroundings decreased because
energy left the surroundings to flow into the system.
• This is called an endothermic reaction.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
• For an exothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature
rises due to a release of thermal energy by the reaction.
• This extra thermal energy comes from the conversion of
some of the chemical potential energy in the reactants into
kinetic energy in the form of heat.
• During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken
and new bonds are made.
• The products of the reaction have less chemical potential
energy than the reactants.
• The difference in energy is released as heat.
Particulate View of Exothermic Reactions
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Particulate View of Endothermic Reactions
• In an endothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature
drops due to absorption of some of its thermal energy by
the reaction.
• During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken
and new bonds are made.
• The products of the reaction have more chemical potential
energy than the reactants.
• To acquire this extra energy, some of the thermal energy
of the surroundings is converted into chemical potential
energy stored in the products.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Enthalpy of Chemical Reaction
• The enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is an extensive
property.
– The more reactants you use, the larger the enthalpy
change.
• By convention, we calculate the enthalpy change for the
number of moles of reactants in the reaction as written.
C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) → 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ΔH = −2044 kJ
 1 mol C3H8(g) = –2044 kJ or 5 mol O2(g) = –2044 kJ
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Enthalpy Stoichiometry
Calculate the heat (in kJ) associated with the complete
combustion of all of the propane in a 13.2 kg propane tank:
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) è 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) ΔHrxn= -2044 kJ
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Measuring ΔH: Calorimetry at Constant
Pressure
• Reactions done in aqueous solution are
at constant pressure.
• The calorimeter is often nested foam
cups containing the solution.
qreaction = –qsolution
 = –(masssolution × Cs, solution × ΔT)
• ΔHreaction = qconstant pressure = qreaction
– To get ΔHreaction per mol, divide by the
number of moles.

Practice Problem: Calorimetry
Magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid:
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) è MgCl2 + H2(g)
you combine 0.158 g of Mg with enough HCl to make 100.0
mL of solution in a coffee-cup calorimeter. T of the solution
rises from 25.6 oC to 32.8 oC. Find ΔHrxn, assume density of
solution is 1.00g/ml
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Hess’s Law: Relationships Involving ΔHrxn
• Enthalpy of a reaction is always associated with a particular reaction.
– If the reaction is changed (e.g., reversed, doubled), the ΔH reflects
those changes.
• Enthalpy is an extensive physical thermal property.
• Example:
– When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ΔHrxn is multiplied by that
factor because ΔHrxn is extensive.
C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ΔH = −393.5 kJ
2 C(s) + 2 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) ΔH = 2(−393.5 kJ) = −787.0 kJ.
– If a reaction is reversed, then the sign of ΔH is changed.
CO2(g) → C(s) + O2(g) ΔH = +393.5 kJ
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Relationships Involving ΔHrxn Hess’s Law
• If a reaction can be expressed as a series of steps, then
the ΔHrxn for the overall reaction is the sum of the heats of
reaction for each step.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Hess’s Law
Find ΔHrxn for:
3C(s) + 4H2(g) è C3H8(g)
use:
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) è 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) ΔH= -2043 kJ
C(s) + O2(g) è CO2(g) ΔH= -393.5 kJ
2H2(g) + O2(g) è 2H2O(g) ΔH= -483.6 kJ
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Bond Energies
• Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in
reactant molecules and making new bonds to
create the products.
• The ΔHreaction can be estimated by comparing the
cost of breaking old bonds to the income from
making new bonds.
• The amount of energy it takes to break one mole
of a bond in a compound is called the bond
energy.
– In the gas state
– Homolytically—each atom gets ½ bonding electrons
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Determining Enthalpies from Bond Energies
• The actual bond energy depends on the surrounding atoms
and other factors.
• Average bond energies can be used to estimate the ΔHrxn.
– Works best when all reactants and products in gas state
• Bond breaking is endothermic, ΔH(breaking) = (+) value.
• Bond making is exothermic, ΔH(making) = (−) value.
ΔHrxn = ∑ (ΔH(bonds broken)) + ∑ (ΔH(bonds formed))
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Trends in Bond Energies
• In general, the more electrons two atoms share, the
stronger the covalent bond.
– Must be comparing bonds between like atoms
– C≡C (837 kJ) &gt; C═C (611 kJ) &gt; C—C (347 kJ)
– C≡N (891 kJ) &gt; C═N (615 kJ) &gt; C—N (305 kJ)
• In general, the shorter the covalent bond, the stronger
the bond.
– Must be comparing similar types of bonds
– Br—F (237 kJ) &gt; Br—Cl (218 kJ) &gt; Br—Br (193 kJ)
– Bonds get weaker down the column.
– Bonds get stronger across the period.

Standard Conditions and Standard
Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf
)
• The standard state is the state of a material at a defined set of
conditions.
– Pure gas at exactly 1 atm pressure
– Pure solid or liquid in its most stable form at exactly 1 atm
pressure and temperature of interest
• Usually 25 °C
– Substance in a solution with concentration 1 M
• The standard enthalpy change, ΔH°
, is the enthalpy change
when all reactants and products are in their standard states.
• The standard enthalpy of formation, ΔHf
°
, is the enthalpy
change for the reaction forming 1 mole of a pure compound from its
constituent elements.
– The elements must be in their standard states.
– The ΔHf
° for a pure element in its standard state = 0 kJ/mol.

Calculating Standard Enthalpy Change
for a Reaction
• Any reaction can be written as the sum of formation
reactions (or the reverse of formation reactions) for the
reactants and products.
• The ΔH° for the reaction is then the sum of the ΔHf
° for
the component reactions.
ΔH°
reaction = ∑nΔHf
°(products) − ∑nΔHf
°(reactants)
∑ means sum.
n is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reaction.

Ionic Bonding and the Crystal Lattice
• The extra energy that is released comes from the formation
of a structure in which every cation is surrounded by
anions, and vice versa.
• This structure is called a crystal lattice.
• The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic
attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.
• The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between
cations and anions, leading to the most stable
arrangement.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Lattice Energy
• The extra stability that accompanies the formation of the
crystal lattice is measured as the lattice energy.
• The lattice energy is the energy released when the solid
crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.
– Always exothermic
– Hard to measure directly, but can be calculated from
knowledge of other processes
• Lattice energy depends directly on the size of charges and
inversely on distance between ions.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Determining Lattice Energy:
The Born–Haber Cycle
• The Born–Haber cycle is a hypothetical series of
reactions that represents the formation of an ionic
compound from its constituent elements.
• The reactions are chosen so that the change in enthalpy
of each reaction is known except for the last one, which
is the lattice energy.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Born–Haber Cycle and Hess’s Law
• Use Hess’s law to add up enthalpy changes of other reactions to
determine the lattice energy.
• ΔHf
(salt) = ΔHf
(metal atoms, g) + ΔHf
(nonmetal atoms, g)
+ ΔHf
(cations, g) + ΔHf
(anions, g) + ΔH° (crystal lattice)
• ΔH°(crystal lattice) = lattice energy
– For metal atom(g) → cation(g), ΔHf
 = first ionization energy
• Don’t forget to add together all the ionization energies to
get to the desired cation.
– M2+ = 1st IE + 2nd IE
– For nonmetal atoms (g) → anions (g), ΔHf
 = electron affinity
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Size
• The force of attraction between charged particles is
inversely proportional to the distance between them.
• Larger ions mean the center of positive charge (nucleus
of the cation) is farther away from the negative charge
(electrons of the anion).
– Larger ion = weaker attraction
– Weaker attraction = smaller lattice energy
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Lattice Energy versus Ion Size
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Charge
• The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is
directly proportional to the product of the charges.
• Larger charge means the ions are more strongly attracted.
– Larger charge = stronger attraction
– Stronger attraction = larger lattice energy
• Of the two factors, ion charge is generally more important.
