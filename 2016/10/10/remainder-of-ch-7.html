<h2 id="acidbase-chemical-reactions">Acid–Base Chemical Reactions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Acid–Base Reaction:
– An acid reacts with a base producing water (or in some cases a weak electrolyte) and a salt.
– An acid–base reaction is also called a neutralization reaction.</li>
  <li>In acid–base reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acidbase-reactions">Acid–Base Reactions</h2>

<p>• When an acid and base react, the reaction is called a <em>neutralization reaction</em>.
  – Example:
    + 2 HNO3(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
• As long as the salt that forms is soluble in water, the net ionic equation for an acid–base reaction is:
  + H+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)
• A neutralization reaction is completed when the moles of acid equal the moles of base in the solution.
  – Moles of acid = Moles of base
• A neutralization reaction does not always mean that the pH of the solution is 7.</p>

<h2 id="acids-and-bases-in-solution">Acids and Bases in Solution</h2>

<p>• Acids ionize in water to form H+ ions; more precisely, the H from the acid molecule is donated to a water molecule to form hydronium ion, H3O+.
• Most chemists use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably.
• Bases dissociate in water to form OH– ions.
  – Bases, such as NH3, that do not contain OH– ions produce OH– by pulling H off water molecules.
• In the reaction of an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid combines with the OH– from the base to make water.
– The cation from the base combines with the anion from the acid to make the salt.

<ul>
  <li>HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)</li>
  <li>The reaction of hydrochloric acid (acid) and sodium hydroxide (base) forms sodium chloride (soluble salt) and water.</li>

      <li>H2SO4(aq) + LiOH(aq) → H2O(l) + Li2SO4</li>
      <li>H2SO4(aq) + 2 LiOH(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + Li2SO4(aq)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acidbase-titrations">Acid–Base Titrations</h2>

<p>• In a <em>titration</em>, a substance in a solution of known concentration is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration.
• When exactly enough solution has been added the reactants are in their stoichiometric ratio. Called the <em>equivalence point</em>
• The solution of known concentration is added slowly from an instrument called a burette.
• A long glass tube with precise volume markings that allows small additions of solution
• The titrant is the solution in the burette.
+ <img src="assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-35f33.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="acidbase-titrations-1">Acid–Base Titrations</h2>

<p>• In acid–base titrations, because both the reactant and product solutions are colorless, a chemical is added that changes color when the solution undergoes large changes in acidity/alkalinity.
  – The chemical is called an <em>indicator</em>.
• The <em>endpoint</em> of a reaction is when the indicator color changes.
• The endpoint of an acid–base titration is where the number of moles of H+ equals the number of moles of OH–.
  – This is known as the <em>equivalence point</em>.</p>

• In this titration, NaOH is added to a dilute HCl solution. When the NaOH and HCl reach stoichiometric proportions (the equivalence point), the indicator changes color to pink.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practice-problem-acidbase-titration">Practice Problem: Acid–Base Titration</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The titration of a 10.00 mL sample of HCL solution of unknown concentration requires 12.54 ml of a 0.100 M NaOH solution to reach the equivalence point. What is the concentration of the unknown HCl solution in M?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gas-evolution-chemical-reactions">Gas-Evolution Chemical Reactions</h2>

<p>• In a gas-evolution reaction, a gas forms, resulting in bubbling.
• In both acid–base and gas-evolution reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.
  – Many gas-evolution reactions are also acid– base reactions.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-gas-evolution-reactions">Example of Gas-Evolution Reactions</h2>

<p>• Some reactions form a gas directly from the ion exchange.
  + K2S(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + H2S(g)
• Other reactions form a gas by the decomposition of one of the ion exchange products into a gas and water.
  + NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2CO3(aq)
  + H2CO3(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)</p>

<h2 id="gas-evolution-reaction">Gas-Evolution Reaction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) H2O(l) + NaCl(aq) + CO2(g)</li>
  <li>When aqueous sodium bicarbonate is mixed with aqueous hydrochloric acid, gaseous CO2 bubbles are the result of the reaction.</li>

<h2 id="oxidationreduction-reactions">Oxidation–Reduction Reactions</h2>

<p>• The reactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to the other are called oxidation–reduction reactions.
  – These are also called redox reactions.
  – Many redox reactions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen.
  – Examples:
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g) (combustion)
  + 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)
  + 4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) (rusting)</p>

<h2 id="oxidation-and-reduction-redox">Oxidation and Reduction (Redox)</h2>

<p>• To convert a free element into an ion, the atoms must gain or lose electrons.
  – NOTE: If one atom loses electrons, another must accept them.
• Atoms that <em>lose electrons</em> are being <em>oxidized</em>.
  – The reaction is referred to as <em>oxidation</em>.
• Atoms that <em>gain electrons</em> are being <em>reduced</em>.
  – The reaction is referred to as <em>reduction</em>.
+ Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na → Na+ + 1 e– (oxidation; sodium lost electrons)
  +  Cl2 + 2 e– → 2 Cl– (reduction; chlorine atom gained electrons)</p>

<h2 id="redox-reactions">Redox Reactions</h2>

<p>• Oxidation and reduction must occur simultaneously.
  – If an atom loses electrons, another atom must take them.
• The reactant that reduces an element in another reactant is called the reducing agent.
  – The <em>reducing agent</em> contains the element that is oxidized.
• The reactant that oxidizes an element in another reactant is called the <em>oxidizing agent</em>.
  – The oxidizing agent contains the element that is reduced.
• Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na is oxidized, while Cl is reduced.
  + Na is the reducing agent, and Cl2 is the oxidizing agent.</p>

<h2 id="oxidation-states-electron-book-keeping">Oxidation States: “Electron Book Keeping”</h2>

<p>• For reactions that are not metal + nonmetal, or do not involve O2, a method for determining how the electrons are transferred is required to determine which element is being oxidized and which element is being reduced.
• Chemists assign a number to each element in a reaction called an <em>oxidation state</em> that allows them to determine the electron flow in the reaction.
  – Even though they look like them, oxidation states are not ion charges!
    • Oxidation states are imaginary charges assigned based on a set of rules.
    • Ion charges are real, measurable charges.</p>

<h2 id="rules-for-assigning-oxidation-states">Rules for Assigning Oxidation States</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The following rules are in order of priority:
    <ol>
      <li>Free elements have an oxidation state = 0.
– Na = 0 and Cl2 = 0 in 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g)</li>
      <li>Monatomic ions have an oxidation state equal to their charge.
– Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl</li>
      <li>(a) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound is 0.
– Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl, (+1) + (−1) = 0</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rules-for-assigning-oxidation-states-continued">Rules for Assigning Oxidation States Continued</h2>

<ol>
  <li>(b) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a polyatomic ion equals the charge on the ion.
  – N = +5 and O = −2 in NO3 –, (+5) + 3(−2) = −1</li>
  <li>(a) Group I metals have an oxidation state of +1 in all their compounds.
  – Na = +1 in NaCl</li>
  <li>(b) Group II metals have an oxidation state of +2 in all their compounds.
  – Mg = +2 in MgCl2</li>
  <li>In their compounds, nonmetals have oxidation states according to the following table.
  – Nonmetals higher on the table take priority.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rules-for-assigning-oxidation-states-1">Rules for Assigning Oxidation States</h2>

<ul>
  <li><img src="assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-7847e.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practice-problem-assigning-oxidation-states">Practice Problem: Assigning Oxidation States</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assign an oxidation state to each atom in each element, ion or compound
(a) Cl2 (b) Na+ (c) KF (d) CO2 (e) SO4^2- (f) K2O2</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identifying-redox-reactions">Identifying Redox Reactions</h2>

<p>• Oxidation: An increase in oxidation state
• Reduction: A decrease in oxidation state
  – Carbon changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of +4.
    • Carbon loses electrons and is oxidized.
  – Sulfur changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of –2.
    • Sulfur gains electrons and is reduced.</p>

<h2 id="redox-reaction">Redox Reaction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NOTE:
• The transfer of electrons does not need to be a complete transfer (as
occurs in the formation of an ionic compound) for the reaction to
qualify as oxidation–reduction.
– For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas:
    <ul>
      <li>H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)
• When hydrogen bonds to chlorine, the electrons are unevenly shared, resulting in:
• An increase of electron density (reduction) for chlorine
• A decrease in electron density (oxidation) for hydrogen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="combustion-as-redox">Combustion as Redox</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)</li>
  <li>Hydrogen and Oxygen reacts to form water in the gaseous state (steam).</li>
  <li><img src="assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-0a7d6.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practice-problem-oxidation-states-and-identifying">Practice Problem: Oxidation States and Identifying</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What Is Being Oxidized and What Is Being Reduced Use oxidation state to identify the element that is oxidized
and the element that is reduced:</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="redox-without-combustion">Redox without Combustion</h2>

<ul>
