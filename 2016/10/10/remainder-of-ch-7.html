<p>Chemical Reactions and Chemical Quantities</p>

<p>Climate Change and Combustion of Fossil Fuels:
The Greenhouse Effect
• Greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere:
– Allow sunlight to enter
the atmosphere
– Warm Earth’s surface
– Prevent some of the
heat generated by the
sunlight from escaping
The balance between incoming
and outgoing energy from the sun
determines Earth’s average
temperature.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Global Warming
• Scientists have measured an average &gt;0.8 °C
rise in atmospheric temperature since 1860.
• During the same period, atmospheric CO2 levels
have risen &gt;25%.
• Are the two trends causal?

How Much Matters
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Physical Changes in Matter
What is a physical change?
• Changes that alter only the
state or appearance, but
not composition, are physical
changes.
• The atoms or molecules that
compose a substance do not
change their identity during a
physical change. • When water boils, it changes its
state from a liquid to a gas.
• The gas remains composed of
water molecules, so this is
a physical change.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
How much Energy needed to
convert liquid water to water
vapor?
Chapter 10
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Chemical Changes in Matter
What is a chemical change?
• Changes that alter the
composition of matter are
chemical changes.
• During a chemical change, atoms
rearrange, transforming the
original substances into different
substances.
• A rusting nail is a chemical change.
• Rust occurs when the iron atoms
exchange electrons with oxygen atoms—
combining to form a NEW or different
chemical substance.
• Iron rust is the compound iron(III) oxide
(Fe2O3).
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Chemical Reactions
• Reactions involve chemical changes in matter resulting
in new substances.
• Reactions involve rearrangement and exchange of
atoms to produce new molecules.
• A chemical reaction is a written statement.
– It states the quantities, the chemical identity of the
substances in the reaction, and their physical state.
– Example:
 CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)
Reactants → Products
Reactants → Products

© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Chemical Equations
Chemical equations:
• Provide information about the reaction
– Molecular or ionic formulas of reactants and products
– States of reactants and products
• Gas (g), liquid (l), solid (s), and aqueous (aq)
– Relative numbers of reactant and product molecules
that are required
– Can be used to determine weights of reactants used
and products that can be made
Chemical Equations:
Short hand for Describing a Chemical Reaction
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
The Quantities in Chemical Reactions
• The amount of every substance used and made in a chemical
reaction is related to the amounts of all the other substances in the
reaction.
– Law of conservation of mass
– Balancing equations by balancing atoms
• The study of the numerical relationship between chemical quantities
in a chemical reaction is called stoichiometry.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical
Equations
Write a balanced equation for the reaction between solid
cobalt (III) oxide and solid carbon to produce solid cobalt and
carbon dioxide gas
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical
Equations
Write a balanced equation for the combustion of gaseous butane
(C4H10) with gaseous oxygen to give carbon dioxide and gaseous
water.

Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical
Equations
Write a balanced equation for the reaction between aqueous
strontium chloride and aqueous lithium phosphate to form solid
strontium phosphate and aqueous lithium chloride
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Reaction Stoichiometry: What Is it about?
• The coefficients in a chemical reaction specify the relative
amounts in molecules and in moles of each of the
substances involved in
the reaction.
2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
• What the above BALANCED chemical equation says:
2 molecules of C8H18 react with 25 molecules of O2 to form 16
molecules of CO2 and 18 molecules of H2O.
2 moles of C8H18 react with 25 moles of O2 to form 16 moles of CO2
and 18 moles of H2O.
2 mol C8H18 : 25 mol O2 : 16 mol CO2 : 18 mol H2O
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Cooking Stoichiometry: Making Pizza
• The number of pizzas you can make depends on the
amount of ingredients you use.
This relationship can be expressed mathematically.
1 crust : 5 oz. sauce : 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza
• We can compare the amount of pizza that can be made
from 10 cups of cheese:
– Since 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza, then,
1 crust + 5 oz. tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese → 1 pizza
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Mole-to-Mole Conversions
• In the same way that the ratio was used from the pizza recipe
example, the stoichiometric ratio acts as a conversion factor
between the amount in moles of a reactant to moles of a product.
– Reactant to product:
• Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 16 moles CO2
• Stoichiometric ratio can be between:
– Reactant to reactant
• Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 25 moles O2
– Product to product:
• Stoichiometric ratio: 16 moles CO2 : 18 moles H2O
2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
How Many Moles of CO2 Form If 22.0 Moles of
C8H18 Are combusted (Burned)?
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mass Conversions
Stoichiometric ratios can be used as a conversion factor between the
amount in grams (mass) of a reactant used to determine mass (grams)
of a product made.</p>

<p>• Strategy: A is reactant and B is the product.
Mass of A → Moles of A → Stoichiometric ratio B : A → Moles B → Mass B
mass A × (1 mole A/mol.mass A) × (mole B/mole A) × (mol.mass B/1 mol B)

Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mass Conversions
Problem:
Determine the mass (grams) of CO2 produced when 3.6 × 1015 grams of
C8H18 is burned in excess oxygen gas.
Strategy:
• Need a balanced reaction
• From the balance reaction, use the stoichiometric relationship between
C8H18 and CO2.
Mass of C8H18 → Moles of C8H18 → Stoichiometric ratio 2 C8H18 : 16 CO2
→ Moles of CO2 → Mass of CO2
2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)

Problem:
Determine the mass (grams) of CO2 produced when 3.6 ×
1015 grams of C8H18 is burned in excess oxygen gas.
2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)

Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield
Back to the pizza recipe:
1 crust + 5 oz. tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese → 1 pizza
Suppose you have 4 crusts, 10 cups of cheese, and 15 oz. tomato sauce.
How many pizzas can you make?
Strategy:
We have enough crusts to make
We have enough cheese to make
We have enough tomato sauce to make
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Limiting Reactant: Pizza Problem Continued
• We have enough crusts for 4 pizzas, enough cheese for 5 pizzas,
but ONLY enough tomato sauce for 3 pizzas.
– Therefore, only 3 pizzas can be made.
– The tomato sauce limits how many pizzas can be made.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield
Connection
• In the pizza analogy, the tomato sauce is the limiting reactant, the
reactant that makes the least amount of product.
• The limiting reactant is also known as the limiting reagent.
• The maximum number of pizzas that can be made depends on this
ingredient, the tomato sauce.
– In chemical reactions, this is called the theoretical yield.
• Theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a
chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
– Example:
• The ingredient that makes the least amount of pizza
determines how many pizzas you can make (theoretical
yield).
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
More Making Pizzas
• Assume that while making pizzas, a pizza is burnt or
dropped on the floor and only two pizzas are available
to eat.
• The actual amount of product made in a chemical reaction
is called the actual yield.
• Actual yield is about efficiency.
– To determine your efficiency in making pizzas, a percentage value
can be calculated.
– In chemical reactions, this is called a percent yield.
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Summarizing Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield
• The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that is
completely consumed in a chemical reaction and limits the amount of
product.
• The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity
greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant.
• The theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a
chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
• The actual yield is the amount of product actually produced by a
chemical reaction.
• The percent yield is calculated as:
(actual yield /theoretical yield) × 100 = percent yield%
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Chemical Reaction
• In reactions with multiple reactants, it is likely that one of the
reactants will be completely used before the others.
– When this reactant is used up, the reaction stops and no more
product is made.
• The reactant that limits the amount of product is called the limiting
reactant.
– It is sometimes called the limiting reagent.
– The limiting reactant gets completely consumed.
• Reactants not completely consumed are called excess reactants.
– The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity
greater than is required to completely react with the limiting
reactant.
• The amount of product that can be made from the limiting reactant
is called the theoretical yield.

Combustion: A Type of Chemical Reaction
• A combustion reaction involves the reaction of a
substance with O2 to form one or more oxygen
containing compounds.
• Other products of a combustion reaction:
– Water(H2O) and Heat(energy)
• Example: Combustion of methane
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) + Heat
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Practice Problem: Combustion Reaction
How many grams of products are formed during the
combustion of 100. g of ethanol? (and how much oxygen
is consumed?
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Overview of Alkali Metals:
• The alkali metals (group 1A) have ns1 outer electron configurations.
– Form +1 cation to “achieve” noble gas configuration.
• The reactions of the alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous.
• Common reaction for alkali metals (M) is with halogens (X)
 2 M + X2 → 2 MX
– Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
• The alkali metals react vigorously with water to form the dissolved alkali metal
ion, the hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas:
 2 M(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 M+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq) + H2(g)
– The reaction is highly exothermic and can be explosive because the heat
from the reaction can ignite the hydrogen gas.
Alkali Metal Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction
© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.
Halogen Overview:
• Group 7 elements that have ns2np5 outer electron configurations:
– Mostly form –1 anions (F only forms –1 anion) to achieve the “noble gas
configuration”
– Most reactive of the nonmetal elements
• The halogens (X) tend to react with metals especially with Group 1 and 2A
metals to form ionic compounds such as metal halides (MXn).
 2 M + n X2 → 2 MXn
– Example: 2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) → 2 FeCl3(s)
• The halogens react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.
 H2( g) + X2 → 2 HX(g)
