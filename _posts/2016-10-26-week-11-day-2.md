## Solution Stoichiometry

+ Audio 0:07:44.395193
+ Molarity (moles solute/liter of solution) relates the moles of solute to the liters of solution.
  + Molarity can be used to convert between amount of reactants and/ or products in a chemical reaction when either the reactant or product is given in volume.
+ Example: 20.0 mL of 0.50 M NaCl
+ Molarity of A × Volume of A = moles A

## Types of Aqueous Solutions and Solubility

+ Audio 0:20:31.538420
+ You can't add infinite amounts of solute to your solution
+ Consider two familiar aqueous solutions: salt water and
sugar water.
  + Salt water is a homogeneous mixture of NaCl and H2O.
  + Sugar water is a homogeneous mixture of C12H22O11 and H2O.
+ How do solids such as salt and sugar dissolve in water?
  + Likes dissolve likes.
  + If your solute has roughly similar properties to your solvent, it will dissolve

## What Happens When a Solute Dissolves?

+ Audio 0:23:19.196102
+ There are attractive forces between the solute particles holding them together.
+ There are also attractive forces between the solvent molecules.
+ When we mix the solute with the solvent, there are attractive forces between the solute particles and the solvent molecules.
+ If the attractions between solute and solvent are strong enough, the solute will dissolve.

## Charge Distribution in a Water Molecule

+ Audio 0:25:45.466724
+ There is an uneven distribution of electrons
within the water molecule.
  + This causes the oxygen side of the molecule to have a partial negative charge (δ–) and the hydrogen side to have a partial positive charge (δ+).

## Solute and Solvent Interactions in an Ionic Solution: A Salt Solution

+ Audio 0:26:59.261993
+ When sodium chloride is put into water, the attraction of Na+ and Cl– ions to water molecules competes with the attraction among the oppositely charged ions themselves.
  + Sodium chloride is an ionic compound (metal + nonmetal).
  + Ionic compounds when dissolved in water are called salt solutions.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-8bdc5.png)

## Sodium Chloride (NaCl) Dissolving in Water

+ Each ion is attracted to the surrounding water molecules and pulled off and away from the crystal.
+ When it enters the solution, the ion is surrounded by water molecules, insulating it from other ions.
+ The result is a solution with free moving charged
particles able to conduct electricity.

## Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions

+ Audio 0:29:17.039172
+ Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will conduct electricity are called *electrolytes*.
+ Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will not conduct electricity are called *nonelectrolytes*.
+ A solution of salt (an electrolyte) conducts electrical current. A solution of sugar (a nonelectrolyte) does not.

## Electrolyte Solutions: What Are They?

+ Audio 0:31:02.947720
+ *Electrolytes* are classified by how they dissolve in water.
  + If their dissociation is into ions:
    + Strong electrolytes
      + Completely dissociate into ions
      + Example: CaCl2(s) → Ca2+ + 2 Cl−
    + Weak electrolytes
      + Partial dissociation into their ions
      + Example: HCOOH(aq) H+ + HCOO−
  + Molecular compounds that dissolve in water but do not form ions when they go into solution are called nonelectrolytes.

## Electrolyte Solutions: Strong and Weak

+ Audio 0:32:53.074436
+ *Ionic substances* such as sodium chloride (NaCl) that completely dissociate into ions when they dissolve in water are *strong electrolytes*.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-aacc8.png)
+ *Acids* are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give H+
+ *Bases* are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give OH-
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-8adef.png)
+ Depending on the acid or base, their dissociation in water can be complete or partial.
  + Example:
    + HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid is a strong acid.
      + It dissociates completely in water.
        + HCl would be a *strong electrolyte*.
    + Acetic acid (e.g., vinegar) (HC2H3O2) is a weak acid—it dissociates partially in water.
      + HC2H3O2 is a *weak electrolyte*.

  + A) 0.045 M Al2(SO4)3
  + B) 0.050 M (NH4)2CO3
  + C) 0.10 M NaBr
  + D) 0.10 M Kl
  + E) 0.10 M KF

## Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions

+ Sugar (C12H22O11) is a molecular compound.
  + Most *molecular compounds* (except for acids and bases) dissolve in water as intact molecules.

## The Solubility of Ionic Compounds

+ Audio 0:39:50.836785
+ When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the resulting solution contains:
  + Not the intact ionic compound itself, but its component ions dissolved in water
+ NOT all ionic compounds dissolve in water.
  + Example:
    + If we add AgCl to water, for example, it remains solid and appears as a white powder at the bottom of the water.
+ In general, a compound is termed *soluble* if it dissolves in water and *insoluble* if it does not.

## Solubility of Salts

+ Audio 0:41:22.482755
+ If solid silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to water, it dissolves and forms a strong electrolyte solution.
+ Silver chloride (AgCl), on the other hand, is almost completely insoluble.
  + If solid AgCl is mixed with water, virtually all of it remains as a solid within the liquid water.

## When Will a Salt Dissolve?

+ Audio 0:41:46.575491
+ Whether a particular compound is soluble or insoluble depends on several factors.
+ Predicting whether a compound will dissolve in water is not easy.
+ The best way to do it is to do some experiments to test whether a compound will dissolve in water, and then develop some rules based on those experimental results.
