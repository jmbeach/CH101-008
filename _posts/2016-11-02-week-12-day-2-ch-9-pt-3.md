## Acid–Base Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:08:22.756094
+ Audio 0:12:28.774412
+ Acid–Base Reaction:
  + An acid reacts with a base producing water (or in some cases a weak electrolyte) and a salt.
  + An acid–base reaction is also called a neutralization reaction.
+ In acid–base reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.

## Acid–Base Reactions

+ Audio 0:13:19.839427
+ When an acid and base react, the reaction is called a *neutralization reaction*.
  + Example:
    + 2 HNO3(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
+ As long as the salt that forms is soluble in water, the net ionic equation for an acid–base reaction is:
  + H+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)
+ A neutralization reaction is completed when the moles of acid equal the moles of base in the solution.
  + Moles of acid = Moles of base
+ A neutralization reaction does not always mean that the pH of the solution is 7.

## Acids and Bases in Solution

+ Audio 0:16:36.637260
+ Acids ionize in water to form H+ ions; more precisely, the H from the acid molecule is donated to a water molecule to form hydronium ion, H3O+.
+ Most chemists use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably.
+ Bases dissociate in water to form OH– ions.
  + Bases, such as NH3, that do not contain OH– ions produce OH– by pulling H off water molecules.
+ In the reaction of an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid combines with the OH– from the base to make water.
– The cation from the base combines with the anion from the acid to make the salt.

  + HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → H2O(l) + BaCl2
  + 2 HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + BaCl2(aq)

## Predict the Product of Acid–Base Reactions

+ Audio 0:18:17.410585
+ H2SO4(aq) + LiOH(aq) → ?
+ (H+ + SO4 2−) + (Li+ + OH−) → (H+ + OH−) + (Li+ + SO4 2−)
  + H2SO4(aq) + LiOH(aq) → H2O(l) + Li2SO4
  + H2SO4(aq) + 2 LiOH(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + Li2SO4(aq)

## Acid–Base Titrations

+ Audio 0:21:37.385327
+ This is a problem because some things can not be legally put down the sink and it depends on the acidity
+ In a *titration*, a substance in a solution of known concentration is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration.
+ When exactly enough solution has been added the reactants are in their stoichiometric ratio. Called the *equivalence point*
  + The solution of known concentration is added slowly from an instrument called a burette.
    + A long glass tube with precise volume markings that allows small additions of solution
+ The titrant is the solution in the burette.

## Acid–Base Titrations

+ Audio 0:25:27.198386
+ In acid–base titrations, because both the reactant and product solutions are colorless, a chemical is added that changes color when the solution undergoes large changes in acidity/alkalinity.
  + The chemical is called an *indicator*.
+ The *endpoint* of a reaction is when the indicator color changes.
+ The endpoint of an acid–base titration is where the number of moles of H+ equals the number of moles of OH–.
  + This is known as the *equivalence point*.

## Gas-Evolution Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:41:08.439627
+ In a gas-evolution reaction, a gas forms, resulting in bubbling.
+ In both acid–base and gas-evolution reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.
  + Many gas-evolution reactions are also acid– base reactions.

## Example of Gas-Evolution Reactions

+ Audio 0:42:31.119388
+ Some reactions form a gas directly from the ion exchange.
  + K2S(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + H2S(g)
+ Other reactions form a gas by the decomposition of one of the ion exchange products into a gas and water.
  + NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2CO3(aq)
  + H2CO3(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)

## Gas-Evolution Reaction

## Oxidation–Reduction Reactions

+ The reactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to the other are called oxidation–reduction reactions.
  + These are also called redox reactions.
  + Many redox reactions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen.
  + Examples:
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g) (combustion)
  + 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)
  + 4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) (rusting)

## Oxidation and Reduction (Redox)

+ To convert a free element into an ion, the atoms must gain or lose electrons.
  + NOTE: If one atom loses electrons, another must accept them.
+ Atoms that *lose electrons* are being *oxidized*.
  + The reaction is referred to as *oxidation*.
+ Atoms that *gain electrons* are being *reduced*.
  + The reaction is referred to as *reduction*.
+ Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na → Na+ + 1 e– (oxidation; sodium lost electrons)
  +  Cl2 + 2 e– → 2 Cl– (reduction; chlorine atom gained electrons)

## Redox Reactions

+ Oxidation and reduction must occur simultaneously.
  + If an atom loses electrons, another atom must take them.
+ The reactant that reduces an element in another reactant is called the reducing agent.
  + The *reducing agent* contains the element that is oxidized.
+ The reactant that oxidizes an element in another reactant is called the *oxidizing agent*.
  + The oxidizing agent contains the element that is reduced.
+ Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na is oxidized, while Cl is reduced.
  + Na is the reducing agent, and Cl2 is the oxidizing agent.

## Oxidation States: “Electron Book Keeping”

+ For reactions that are not metal + nonmetal, or do not involve O2, a method for determining how the electrons are transferred is required to determine which element is being oxidized and which element is being reduced.
+ Chemists assign a number to each element in a reaction called an *oxidation state* that allows them to determine the electron flow in the reaction.
  + Even though they look like them, oxidation states are not ion charges!
    + Oxidation states are imaginary charges assigned based on a set of rules.
    + Ion charges are real, measurable charges.

## Rules for Assigning Oxidation States

+ The following rules are in order of priority:
1. Free elements have an oxidation state = 0.
  + Na = 0 and Cl2 = 0 in 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g)
2. Monatomic ions have an oxidation state equal to their charge.
  + Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl
3. (a) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound is 0.
  + Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl, (+1) + (−1) = 0

## Rules for Assigning Oxidation States Continued

3. (b) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a polyatomic ion equals the charge on the ion.
  + N = +5 and O = −2 in NO3 –, (+5) + 3(−2) = −1
4. (a) Group I metals have an oxidation state of +1 in all their compounds.
  + Na = +1 in NaCl
4. (b) Group II metals have an oxidation state of +2 in all their compounds.
  + Mg = +2 in MgCl2
5. In their compounds, nonmetals have oxidation states according to the following table.
  + Nonmetals higher on the table take priority.

## Practice Problem: Assigning Oxidation States

+ Assign an oxidation state to each atom in each element, ion or compound
(a) Cl2 (b) Na+ (c) KF (d) CO2 (e) SO4^2- (f) K2O2

## Identifying Redox Reactions

+ Oxidation: An increase in oxidation state
+ Reduction: A decrease in oxidation state
  + Carbon changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of +4.
    + Carbon loses electrons and is oxidized.
  + Sulfur changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of –2.
    + Sulfur gains electrons and is reduced.

## Redox Reaction

+ NOTE:
+ The transfer of electrons does not need to be a complete transfer (as
occurs in the formation of an ionic compound) for the reaction to
qualify as oxidation–reduction.
  + For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas:
    + H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)
+ When hydrogen bonds to chlorine, the electrons are unevenly shared, resulting in:
  + An increase of electron density (reduction) for chlorine
  + A decrease in electron density (oxidation) for hydrogen

## Combustion as Redox

+ 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)
+ Hydrogen and Oxygen reacts to form water in the gaseous state (steam).
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-0a7d6.png)

## Practice Problem: Oxidation States and Identifying

+ What Is Being Oxidized and What Is Being Reduced Use oxidation state to identify the element that is oxidized
and the element that is reduced:
+ Mg(s) +2 H2O(l) à Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)

## Redox without Combustion

+ 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
+ Sodium metal transfers electrons to chlorine gas to form solid sodium chloride. The sodium metal is reduced and chlorine is oxidized.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-bce0d.png)

## Practice Problem: Oxidation States and Identifying

+ What Is Being Oxidized and What Is Being Reduced
+ Determine whether or not each reaction is an oxidation-reduction reaction. For each oxidation-reduction reaction, identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent.
  + a) 2 Mg(s) + O2(g) à 2 MgO(s)
  + b) 2HBr(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) à 2 H2O(l) + CaBr2(aq)
  + c) Zn(s) + Fe2+(aq) à Zn2+(aq) + Fe(s)
