## How to Name an Oxyacid

+ Audio 0:03:09.986990
+ If a polyatomic ion name ends in
  + –ate, then change the ending to a
  + –ic suffix.
  + Example:
    + NO3 − is the nitrate ion, so it would become nitric.

+ If a polyatomic ion name ends in
  + –ite, then change the ending to a
  + –ous suffix.
  + Example:
    + SO3 2− is the sulfite ion, so it would become sulfurous.

+ Finally, write the word acid at the end of all names.

## Acid–Base Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:08:22.756094
+ Audio 0:12:28.774412
+ Acid–Base Reaction:
  + An acid reacts with a base producing water (or in some cases a weak electrolyte) and a salt.
  + An acid–base reaction is also called a neutralization reaction.
+ In acid–base reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.

## Acid–Base Reactions

+ Audio 0:13:19.839427
+ When an acid and base react, the reaction is called a *neutralization reaction*.
  + Example:
    + 2 HNO3(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
+ As long as the salt that forms is soluble in water, the net ionic equation for an acid–base reaction is:
  + H+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)
+ A neutralization reaction is completed when the moles of acid equal the moles of base in the solution.
  + Moles of acid = Moles of base
+ A neutralization reaction does not always mean that the pH of the solution is 7.

## Acids and Bases in Solution

+ Audio 0:16:36.637260
+ Acids ionize in water to form H+ ions; more precisely, the H from the acid molecule is donated to a water molecule to form hydronium ion, H3O+.
+ Most chemists use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably.
+ Bases dissociate in water to form OH– ions.
  + Bases, such as NH3, that do not contain OH– ions produce OH– by pulling H off water molecules.
+ In the reaction of an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid combines with the OH– from the base to make water.
– The cation from the base combines with the anion from the acid to make the salt.

## Acid–Base Reaction

+ HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)
+ The reaction of hydrochloric acid (acid) and sodium hydroxide (base) forms sodium chloride (soluble salt) and water.

## Predict the Product of Acid–Base Reactions

+ HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → ?
+ (H+ + Cl−) + (Ba2+ + OH−) → (H+ + OH−) + (Ba2+ + Cl−)
  + HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → H2O(l) + BaCl2
  + 2 HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + BaCl2(aq)

## Predict the Product of Acid–Base Reactions

+ Audio 0:18:17.410585
+ H2SO4(aq) + LiOH(aq) → ?
+ (H+ + SO4 2−) + (Li+ + OH−) → (H+ + OH−) + (Li+ + SO4 2−)
  + H2SO4(aq) + LiOH(aq) → H2O(l) + Li2SO4
  + H2SO4(aq) + 2 LiOH(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + Li2SO4(aq)

  + C) Fe(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + Fe(NO3)2(aq)
  + D) MgSO4(aq) + Ba(NO3)2(aq) → Mg(NO3)2(aq) + BaSO4(s)

## Acid–Base Titrations

+ Audio 0:21:37.385327
+ This is a problem because some things can not be legally put down the sink and it depends on the acidity
+ In a *titration*, a substance in a solution of known concentration is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration.
+ When exactly enough solution has been added the reactants are in their stoichiometric ratio. Called the *equivalence point*
  + The solution of known concentration is added slowly from an instrument called a burette.
    + A long glass tube with precise volume markings that allows small additions of solution
+ The titrant is the solution in the burette.

## Acid–Base Titrations

+ Audio 0:25:27.198386
+ In acid–base titrations, because both the reactant and product solutions are colorless, a chemical is added that changes color when the solution undergoes large changes in acidity/alkalinity.
  + The chemical is called an *indicator*.
+ The *endpoint* of a reaction is when the indicator color changes.
+ The endpoint of an acid–base titration is where the number of moles of H+ equals the number of moles of OH–.
  + This is known as the *equivalence point*.

## Gas-Evolution Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:41:08.439627
+ In a gas-evolution reaction, a gas forms, resulting in bubbling.
+ In both acid–base and gas-evolution reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.
  + Many gas-evolution reactions are also acid– base reactions.

## Example of Gas-Evolution Reactions

+ Audio 0:42:31.119388
+ Some reactions form a gas directly from the ion exchange.
  + K2S(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + H2S(g)
+ Other reactions form a gas by the decomposition of one of the ion exchange products into a gas and water.
  + NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2CO3(aq)
  + H2CO3(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)

## Gas-Evolution Reaction

+ Audio 0:44:17.526266
+ NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) H2O(l) + NaCl(aq) + CO2(g)
+ When aqueous sodium bicarbonate is mixed with aqueous hydrochloric acid, gaseous CO2 bubbles are the result of the reaction.
