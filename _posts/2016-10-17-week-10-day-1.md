+ Audio 0:01:43.748905
+ Chemical Reactions and Chemical Quantities

## Climate Change and Combustion of Fossil Fuels: The Greenhouse Effect

+ Audio 0:02:03.985553
+ Greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere:
  + Allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere
  + Warm Earth’s surface
  + Prevent some of the heat generated by the sunlight from escaping
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-f7711.png)
    + The balance between incoming and outgoing energy from the sun determines Earth’s average temperature.

## Global Warming

+ Scientists have measured an average >0.8 °C
rise in atmospheric temperature since 1860.
+ During the same period, atmospheric CO2 levels
have risen >25%.
+ Are the two trends causal?

# How Much Matters

+ Audio 0:04:16.146433
+ It's important to know how much CO2 is in the air. We're going to learn how to calculate that

## Physical Changes in Matter

### What is a physical change?

+ Audio 0:04:38.768317
+ Changes that alter *only the state or appearance*, but not composition, are *physical changes*.
+ The atoms or molecules that compose a substance do not change their identity during a physical change.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-0c8b9.png)
+ When water boils, it changes its state from a liquid to a gas.
+ The gas remains composed of water molecules, so this is a physical change.

## Chemical Changes in Matter

### What is a chemical change?

+ Audio 0:05:34.019413
+ Changes that alter the composition of matter are chemical changes.
+ During a chemical change, atoms rearrange, transforming the original substances into different substances.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-891a3.png)
  + A rusting nail is a chemical change.
  + Rust occurs when the iron atoms exchange electrons with oxygen atoms— combining to form a NEW or different chemical substance.
  + Iron rust is the compound iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3).

# Clicker 1

  + A) occurs when methane gas is burned.
  + B) occurs when paper is shredded.
  + C) occurs when water is vaporized.
  + D) occurs when salt is dissolved in water.
  + E) occurs when powdered lemonade is stirred into water.

## Chemical Reactions

## Writing and Balancing Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:10:25.923688
+ Reactions involve chemical changes in matter resulting in new substances.
+ Reactions involve rearrangement and exchange of atoms to produce new molecules.
+ A chemical reaction is a written statement.
  + It states the quantities, the chemical identity of the substances in the reaction, and their physical state.
  + Example:
   + CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)
    + Reactants → Products

## Chemical Equations - Short hand for Describing a Chemical Reaction

+ Chemical equations:
+ Provide information about the reaction
  + Molecular or ionic formulas of reactants and products
  + States of reactants and products
+ Gas (g), liquid (l), solid (s), and aqueous (aq)
  + Relative numbers of reactant and product molecules that are required
  + Can be used to determine weights of reactants used and products that can be made

## The Quantities in Chemical Reactions

+ Audio 0:13:21.733959
+ The amount of every substance used and made in a chemical reaction is related to the amounts of all the other substances in the reaction.
  + Law of conservation of mass
  + Balancing equations by balancing atoms
+ The study of the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a chemical reaction is called *stoichiometry*.

+ Audio 0:33:38.836503
+ Balance the following equation with the smallest whole number coefficients. Choose the answer that is the sum of the coefficients in the balanced equation. Do not forget coefficients of "one."
  + Cr2(SO4)3 + RbOH -> Cr(OH)3 + Rb2SO4
  + A) 10
  + B) 12
  + C) 13
  + D) 14

## Reaction Stoichiometry: What Is it about?

+ Audio 0:36:31.466481
+ The coefficients in a chemical reaction specify the relative amounts in molecules and in moles of each of the
substances involved in the reaction.
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
    + This could mean molecules or moles
+ What the above BALANCED chemical equation says:
  + 2 molecules of C8H18 react with 25 molecules of O2 to form 16 molecules of CO2 and 18 molecules of H2O.
  + 2 moles of C8H18 react with 25 moles of O2 to form 16 moles of CO2 and 18 moles of H2O.
    + 2 mol C8H18 : 25 mol O2 : 16 mol CO2 : 18 mol H2O

## Cooking Stoichiometry: Making Pizza

+ Audio 0:38:36.393984
+ The number of pizzas you can make depends on the
amount of ingredients you use.
+ 1 crust + 5 oz. tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese → 1 pizza
+ This relationship can be expressed mathematically.
  +  1 crust : 5 oz. sauce : 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza
+ We can compare the amount of pizza that can be made from 10 cups of cheese:
  + Since 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza, then:
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-b7e1c.png)
    + 10 cups of cheese = 5 pizzas

## Mole-to-Mole Conversions

+ Audio 0:41:17.963464
+ In the same way that the ratio was used from the pizza recipe example, the *stoichiometric ratio* acts as a conversion factor between the amount in moles of a reactant to moles of a product.
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
  + Reactant to product:
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 16 moles CO2
+ Stoichiometric ratio can be between:
  + Reactant to reactant
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 25 moles O2
  + Product to product:
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 16 moles CO2 : 18 moles H2O

## How Many Moles of CO2 Form If 22.0 Moles of C8H18 Are combusted (Burned)?

## Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mass Conversions

+ Stoichiometric ratios can be used as a conversion factor between the amount in grams (mass) of a reactant used to determine mass (grams) of a product made.
+ Strategy: A is reactant and B is the product.
+ Mass of A → Moles of A → Stoichiometric ratio B : A → Moles B → Mass B
+ mass A × (1 mole A/mol.mass A) × (mole B/mole A) × (mol.mass B/1 mol B)
