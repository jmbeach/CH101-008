+ Acetaldehyde: CH3CHO,
+ Ethenol (aka vinyl alcohol): CH2CHOH
+ oxirane (aka ethylene oxide): CH2OCH2

## Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory: Electron Delocalization

+ In MO theory:
  + Applies Schrödinger’s wave equation to the molecule to calculate a set of *molecular orbitals*
    + The equation solution is estimated.
    + The estimated solution is evaluated and adjusted until the energy of the orbital is minimized.
+ In this treatment, the electrons belong to the whole
molecule, so the orbitals belong to the whole molecule.
  + Delocalization

## LCAO: Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals

+ The simplest guess starts with the atomic orbitals of the atoms adding together to make molecular orbitals; this is called the *linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)* method.
  + Weighted sum
+ Because the orbitals are wave functions, the waves can combine either *constructively* or *destructively*.

## Molecular Orbitals

+ When the wave functions combine constructively, the resulting molecular orbital has less energy than the original atomic orbitals
  + Called a *bonding molecular orbital*
  + Designated: σ, π
  + Most of the electron density between the nuclei
+ When the wave functions combine destructively, the
resulting molecular orbital has more energy than the
original atomic orbital.
  + Called an antibonding molecular orbital
  + Designated: σ*, π*
  + Most of the electron density outside the nuclei
  + Nodes between nuclei

## Molecular Orbital Theory

+ Use Aufbau approach for MO’s (as we did for
individual atoms)
+ electrons go into lowest energy MO’s first
+ pair up when they have to

## Molecular Orbital Theory

+ Electrons in bonding MOs are stabilizing.
  + Lower energy than the atomic orbitals
+ Electrons in antibonding MOs are destabilizing.
  + Higher in energy than atomic orbitals
  + Electron density located outside the internuclear axis
  + Electrons in antibonding orbitals cancel stability gained by electrons in bonding orbitals.

## MO and Properties

+ Bond order = ½ (# Bonding Electrons – # Antibonding
Electrons)
+ Bond order = difference between number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals
  + Only need to consider valence electrons
  + May be a fraction
  + Higher bond order = stronger and shorter bonds
  + If bond order = 0, then the bond is unstable compared to individual atoms and no bond will form.
+ A substance will be paramagnetic if its MO diagram has unpaired electrons.
  + If all electrons are paired, it is diamagnetic.

+ Bond order = ½ (# Bonding Electrons – # Antibonding Electrons)
+ Bond Order H2 = ½ (2 – 0) = 1

## Why Does the Molecule He2+ Exist?

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-d88bd.png)
+ Bond order = ½ (# Bonding Electrons – # Antibonding Electrons)
+ Bond Order He2+ = ½ (2 – 1) =1/2

## Summarizing LCAO–MO Theory

+ Molecular orbitals (MOs) are a linear combination of atomic orbitals (AOs).
  + The total number of MOs formed from a particular set of AOs always equals the number of AOs in the set.
+ When two AOs combine to form two MOs, one MO is lower in energy (the bonding MO) and the other is higher in energy (the antibonding MO).
+ When assigning the electrons of a molecule to MOs, we fill the lowest energy MOs first with a maximum of two spin-paired electrons per orbital.
+ When assigning electrons to two MOs of the same energy, Hund’s rule is followed to fill the orbitals singly first, with parallel spins, before pairing.
+ The bond order in a diatomic molecule is the number of electrons in bonding MOs minus the number in antibonding MOs divided by two.
  + Stable bonds require a positive bond order (more electrons in bonding MOs than in antibonding MOs).
+ MOs are named by type: σ, π, with a subscript to indicate what AOs they were formed from.

## Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecules and Ions

+ When the combining atomic orbitals are identical and of equal energy, the contribution of each atomic orbital to the molecular orbital is equal.
+ When the combining atomic orbitals are different types and energies, contributions to the MOs are different:
+ The more electronegative an atom is, the lower in energy are its orbitals.
+ Lower energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the bonding MOs.
+ Higher energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the antibonding MOs.
+ Nonbonding MOs remain localized on the atom donating its atomic orbitals.

## MO and Polyatomic Molecules

+ When many atoms are combined together, the atomic
orbitals of all the atoms are combined to make a set of
molecular orbitals, which are delocalized over the entire
molecule.
+ Gives results that better match real molecule properties than either Lewis or valence bond theories

## Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors

## Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors

+ The simplest theory of metallic bonding involves the metal atoms releasing their valence electrons to be shared as a pool by all the atoms/ ions in the metal.
  + An organization of metal cation islands in a sea of electrons
  + Electrons delocalized throughout the metal structure
+ Bonding results from attraction of cation for the delocalized electrons.

## Semiconductors and Band Theory

+ Band Theory:
+ Electrons become mobile when they make a transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital into higher energy empty molecular orbitals.
+ These occupied molecular orbitals are referred to as the valence band.
+ The unoccupied orbitals the conduction band.
