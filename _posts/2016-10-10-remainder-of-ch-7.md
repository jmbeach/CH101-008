## Climate Change and Combustion of Fossil Fuels: The Greenhouse Effect

+ Greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere:
  + Allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere
  + Warm Earth’s surface
  + Prevent some of the heat generated by the sunlight from escaping
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-f7711.png)
    + The balance between incoming and outgoing energy from the sun determines Earth’s average temperature.

## Global Warming

+ Scientists have measured an average >0.8 °C
rise in atmospheric temperature since 1860.
+ During the same period, atmospheric CO2 levels
have risen >25%.
+ Are the two trends causal?

# How Much Matters

## Physical Changes in Matter

### What is a physical change?

+ Changes that alter *only the state or appearance*, but not composition, are *physical changes*.
+ The atoms or molecules that compose a substance do not change their identity during a physical change.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-0c8b9.png)
+ When water boils, it changes its state from a liquid to a gas.
+ The gas remains composed of water molecules, so this is a physical change.

## Chemical Changes in Matter

### What is a chemical change?

+ Changes that alter the composition of matter are chemical changes.
+ During a chemical change, atoms rearrange, transforming the original substances into different substances.

  + A rusting nail is a chemical change.
  + Rust occurs when the iron atoms exchange electrons with oxygen atoms— combining to form a NEW or different chemical substance.
  + Iron rust is the compound iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3).

## Chemical Reactions

## Writing and Balancing Chemical Reactions

+ Reactions involve chemical changes in matter resulting in new substances.
+ Reactions involve rearrangement and exchange of atoms to produce new molecules.
+ A chemical reaction is a written statement.
  + It states the quantities, the chemical identity of the substances in the reaction, and their physical state.
  + Example:
   + CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)
    + Reactants → Products

## Chemical Equations - Short hand for Describing a Chemical Reaction

+ Chemical equations:
+ Provide information about the reaction
  + Molecular or ionic formulas of reactants and products
  + States of reactants and products
+ Gas (g), liquid (l), solid (s), and aqueous (aq)
  + Relative numbers of reactant and product molecules that are required
  + Can be used to determine weights of reactants used and products that can be made

## The Quantities in Chemical Reactions

+ The amount of every substance used and made in a chemical reaction is related to the amounts of all the other substances in the reaction.
  + Law of conservation of mass
  + Balancing equations by balancing atoms
+ The study of the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a chemical reaction is called *stoichiometry*.

## Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical Equations

+ Write a balanced equation for the reaction between solid cobalt (III) oxide and solid carbon to produce solid cobalt and carbon dioxide gas

## Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical Equations

## Practice Problem: Balancing and Writing Chemical Equations

+ Write a balanced equation for the reaction between aqueous strontium chloride and aqueous lithium phosphate to form solid strontium phosphate and aqueous lithium chloride

## Reaction Stoichiometry: What Is it about?

+ The coefficients in a chemical reaction specify the relative amounts in molecules and in moles of each of the
substances involved in the reaction.
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
+ What the above BALANCED chemical equation says:
  + 2 molecules of C8H18 react with 25 molecules of O2 to form 16 molecules of CO2 and 18 molecules of H2O.
  + 2 moles of C8H18 react with 25 moles of O2 to form 16 moles of CO2 and 18 moles of H2O.
    + 2 mol C8H18 : 25 mol O2 : 16 mol CO2 : 18 mol H2O

## Cooking Stoichiometry: Making Pizza

+ The number of pizzas you can make depends on the
amount of ingredients you use.
+ 1 crust + 5 oz. tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese → 1 pizza
+ This relationship can be expressed mathematically.
  +  1 crust : 5 oz. sauce : 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza
+ We can compare the amount of pizza that can be made from 10 cups of cheese:
  + Since 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza, then:
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-b7e1c.png)

## Mole-to-Mole Conversions

+ In the same way that the ratio was used from the pizza recipe example, the *stoichiometric ratio* acts as a conversion factor between the amount in moles of a reactant to moles of a product.
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
  + Reactant to product:
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 16 moles CO2
+ Stoichiometric ratio can be between:
  + Reactant to reactant
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C8H18 : 25 moles O2
  + Product to product:
    + Stoichiometric ratio: 16 moles CO2 : 18 moles H2O

## How Many Moles of CO2 Form If 22.0 Moles of C8H18 Are combusted (Burned)?

## Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mass Conversions

+ Stoichiometric ratios can be used as a conversion factor between the amount in grams (mass) of a reactant used to determine mass (grams) of a product made.
+ Strategy: A is reactant and B is the product.
+ Mass of A → Moles of A → Stoichiometric ratio B : A → Moles B → Mass B
+ mass A × (1 mole A/mol.mass A) × (mole B/mole A) × (mol.mass B/1 mol B)

## Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mass Conversions

+ 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
+ Problem:
+ Determine the mass (grams) of CO2 produced when 3.6 × 1015 grams of C8H18 is burned in excess oxygen gas.
+ Strategy:
  + Need a balanced reaction
  + From the balance reaction, use the stoichiometric relationship between C8H18 and CO2.
+ Mass of C8H18 → Moles of C8H18 → Stoichiometric ratio 2 C8H18 : 16 CO2 → Moles of CO2 → Mass of CO2

## Problem: Determine the mass (grams) of CO2 produced when 3.6 × 1015 grams of C8H18 is burned in excess oxygen gas.

+ 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)

## Practice Problem: Stoichiometry plants produce glucose (C6H12O6) from CO2 and water. How much glucose can a plant produce from 37.8 g CO2

## Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield

+ Back to the pizza recipe:
  + 1 crust + 5 oz. tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese → 1 pizza
+ Suppose you have 4 crusts, 10 cups of cheese, and 15 oz. tomato sauce. How many pizzas can you make?
+ Strategy:
+ We have enough crusts to make ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-6b7fa.png)
+ We have enough cheese to make ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-1483e.png)
+ We have enough tomato sauce to make ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-a8257.png)

## Limiting Reactant: Pizza Problem Continued

+ We have enough crusts for 4 pizzas, enough cheese for 5 pizzas, but ONLY enough tomato sauce for 3 pizzas.
  + Therefore, only 3 pizzas can be made.
  + The tomato sauce *limits* how many pizzas can be made.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-bf624.png)

## Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield Connection

+ In the pizza analogy, the tomato sauce is the *limiting reactant*, the reactant that makes the least amount of product.
  + The limiting reactant is also known as the limiting reagent.
+ The maximum number of pizzas that can be made depends on this ingredient, the tomato sauce.
  + In chemical reactions, this is called the *theoretical yield*.
+ Theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
  + Example:
    + The ingredient that makes the least amount of pizza determines how many pizzas you can make (theoretical yield).

## More Making Pizzas

+ Assume that while making pizzas, a pizza is burnt or
dropped on the floor and only two pizzas are available
to eat.
+ The actual amount of product made in a chemical reaction is called the *actual yield*.
+ Actual yield is about efficiency.
  + To determine your efficiency in making pizzas, a percentage value can be calculated.
  + In chemical reactions, this is called a *percent yield*.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-26b94.png)

## Summarizing Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield

+ The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction and limits the amount of product.
+ The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant.
+ The theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
+ The actual yield is the amount of product actually produced by a chemical reaction.
+ The percent yield is calculated as:
  + (actual yield /theoretical yield) × 100 = percent yield%

## Chemical Reaction

+ In reactions with multiple reactants, it is likely that one of the reactants will be completely used before the others.
  + When this reactant is used up, the reaction stops and no more product is made.
+ The reactant that limits the amount of product is called the *limiting reactant*.
  + It is sometimes called the limiting reagent.
  + The limiting reactant gets completely consumed.
+ Reactants not completely consumed are called *excess reactants*.
  + The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant.
+ The amount of product that can be made from the limiting reactant is called the *theoretical yield*.

## Practice Problem: Stoichiometry—Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield

+ Ammonia, NH3, can be synthesized by

## What is the percent yield of C2H2 if 62.80 g of water yields 15.38 g of C2H2 using the following equation.

  + CaC2(s) + 2 H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + C2H2(g)
  + A) 13.84%
  + B) 33.90%
  + C) 91.47%
  + D) 48.10%
  + E) 68.52%

  + Find the limiting reactant and the % yield

## Combustion: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ A *combustion reaction* involves the reaction of a substance with O2 to form one or more oxygen containing compounds.
+ Other products of a combustion reaction:
  + Water(H2O) and Heat(energy)
+ Example: Combustion of methane
+ CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) + Heat

## Practice Problem: Combustion Reaction How many grams of products are formed during the combustion of 100. g of ethanol? (and how much oxygen is consumed)?

## Alkali Metal Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Overview of Alkali Metals:
+ The alkali metals (group 1A) have ns1 outer electron configurations.
  + Form +1 cation to “achieve” noble gas configuration.
+ The reactions of the alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous.
+ Common reaction for alkali metals (M) is with halogens (X)
  + 2 M + X2 → 2 MX
  + Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
+ The alkali metals react vigorously with water to form the dissolved alkali metal ion, the hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas:
  + 2 M(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 M+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq) + H2(g)
  + The reaction is highly exothermic and can be explosive because the heat from the reaction can ignite the hydrogen gas.
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-76f57.png)

## Halogen Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Halogen Overview:
+ Group 7 elements that have ns2np5 outer electron configurations:
  + Mostly form –1 anions (F only forms –1 anion) to achieve the “noble gas configuration”
  + Most reactive of the nonmetal elements
+ The halogens (X) tend to react with metals especially with Group 1 and 2A metals to form ionic compounds such as metal halides (MXn).
  + 2 M + n X2 → 2 MXn
  + Example: 2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) → 2 FeCl3(s)
+ The halogens react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.
  + H2( g) + X2 → 2 HX(g)
