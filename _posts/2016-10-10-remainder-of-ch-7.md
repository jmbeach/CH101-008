## Practice Problem: Stoichiometry—Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield

+ Titanium metal is made by:
  + TiO2(s) + 2 C(s) è Ti(s) + 2CO(g)
+ when 28.6 kg of C reacts with 88.2 kg of TiO2, 42.8 kg of Ti is produced.
  + Find the limiting reactant and the % yield

## Combustion: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ A *combustion reaction* involves the reaction of a substance with O2 to form one or more oxygen containing compounds.
+ Other products of a combustion reaction:
  + Water(H2O) and Heat(energy)
+ Example: Combustion of methane
+ CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) + Heat

## Practice Problem: Combustion Reaction How many grams of products are formed during the combustion of 100. g of ethanol? (and how much oxygen is consumed)?

## Alkali Metal Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Overview of Alkali Metals:
+ The alkali metals (group 1A) have ns1 outer electron configurations.
  + Form +1 cation to “achieve” noble gas configuration.
+ The reactions of the alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous.
+ Common reaction for alkali metals (M) is with halogens (X)
  + 2 M + X2 → 2 MX
  + Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
+ The alkali metals react vigorously with water to form the dissolved alkali metal ion, the hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas:
  + 2 M(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 M+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq) + H2(g)
  + The reaction is highly exothermic and can be explosive because the heat from the reaction can ignite the hydrogen gas.

## Halogen Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Halogen Overview:
+ Group 7 elements that have ns2np5 outer electron configurations:
  + Mostly form –1 anions (F only forms –1 anion) to achieve the “noble gas configuration”
  + Most reactive of the nonmetal elements
+ The halogens (X) tend to react with metals especially with Group 1 and 2A metals to form ionic compounds such as metal halides (MXn).
  + 2 M + n X2 → 2 MXn
  + Example: 2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) → 2 FeCl3(s)
+ The halogens react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.
  + H2( g) + X2 → 2 HX(g)
