## Solution Stoichiometry

+ Molarity (moles solute/liter of solution) relates the moles of solute to the liters of solution.
  + Molarity can be used to convert between amount of reactants and/ or products in a chemical reaction when either the reactant or product is given in volume.
+ Example: 20.0 mL of 0.50 M NaCl
+ Molarity of A × Volume of A = moles A

## Practice Problem: Solution Stoichiometry

+ What volume (in L) of 0.150 M KCl solution will completely react with 0.150 L of a 0.175 M Pb(NO3)2 solution?

## Types of Aqueous Solutions and Solubility

+ Consider two familiar aqueous solutions: salt water and
sugar water.
  + Salt water is a homogeneous mixture of NaCl and H2O.
  + Sugar water is a homogeneous mixture of C12H22O11 and H2O.
+ How do solids such as salt and sugar dissolve in water?
  + Likes dissolve likes.

## What Happens When a Solute Dissolves?

+ There are attractive forces between the solute particles holding them together.
+ There are also attractive forces between the solvent molecules.
+ When we mix the solute with the solvent, there are attractive forces between the solute particles and the solvent molecules.
+ If the attractions between solute and solvent are strong enough, the solute will dissolve.

## Charge Distribution in a Water Molecule

+ There is an uneven distribution of electrons
within the water molecule.
  + This causes the oxygen side of the molecule to have a partial negative charge (δ–) and the hydrogen side to have a partial positive charge (δ+).

## Solute and Solvent Interactions in an Ionic Solution: A Salt Solution

+ When sodium chloride is put into water, the attraction of Na+ and Cl– ions to water molecules competes with the attraction among the oppositely charged ions themselves.
  + Sodium chloride is an ionic compound (metal + nonmetal).
  + Ionic compounds when dissolved in water are called salt solutions.

## Sodium Chloride (NaCl) Dissolving in Water

+ Each ion is attracted to the surrounding water molecules and pulled off and away from the crystal.
+ When it enters the solution, the ion is surrounded by water molecules, insulating it from other ions.
+ The result is a solution with free moving charged
particles able to conduct electricity.

## Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions

+ Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will conduct electricity are called *electrolytes*.
+ Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will not conduct electricity are called *nonelectrolytes*.
+ A solution of salt (an electrolyte) conducts electrical current. A solution of sugar (a nonelectrolyte) does not.

## Electrolyte Solutions: What Are They?

+ Electrolytes are classified by how they dissolve in water.
  + If their dissociation is into ions:
    + Strong electrolytes
      + Completely dissociate into ions
      + Example: CaCl2(s) → Ca2+ + 2 Cl−
    + Weak electrolytes
      + Partial dissociation into their ions
      + Example: HCOOH(aq) H+ + HCOO−
  + Molecular compounds that dissolve in water but do not form ions when they go into solution are called nonelectrolytes.

## Electrolyte Solutions: Strong and Weak

+ *Ionic substances* such as sodium chloride (NaCl) that completely dissociate into ions when they dissolve in water are *strong electrolytes*.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-aacc8.png)
+ *Acids* are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give H+
+ *Bases* are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give OH-
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-8adef.png)
+ Depending on the acid or base, their dissociation in water can be complete or partial.
  + Example:
    + HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid is a strong acid.
      + It dissociates completely in water.
        + HCl would be a *strong electrolyte*.
    + Acetic acid (e.g., vinegar) (HC2H3O2) is a weak acid—it dissociates partially in water.
      + HC2H3O2 is a *weak electrolyte*.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-e329b.png)

## Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions

+ Sugar (C12H22O11) is a molecular compound.
  + Most *molecular compounds* (except for acids and bases) dissolve in water as intact molecules.
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-62e5d.png)
  + *Nonelectrolyte* solution

## Electrolytic Properties of Solution

## The Solubility of Ionic Compounds

+ When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the resulting solution contains:
  + Not the intact ionic compound itself, but its component ions dissolved in water
+ NOT all ionic compounds dissolve in water.
  + Example:
    + If we add AgCl to water, for example, it remains solid and appears as a white powder at the bottom of the water.
+ In general, a compound is termed *soluble* if it dissolves in water and *insoluble* if it does not.

## Solubility of Salts

+ If solid silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to water, it dissolves and forms a strong electrolyte solution.
+ Silver chloride (AgCl), on the other hand, is almost completely insoluble.
  + If solid AgCl is mixed with water, virtually all of it remains as a solid within the liquid water.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-253b6.png)

## When Will a Salt Dissolve?

+ Whether a particular compound is soluble or insoluble depends on several factors.
+ Predicting whether a compound will dissolve in water is not easy.
+ The best way to do it is to do some experiments to test whether a compound will dissolve in water, and then develop some rules based on those experimental results.

## Solubility Rules

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-3ee05.png)

## Practice Problem: Ionic Compound Solubility

+ Predict whether each compound is soluble or insoluble
+ (a) PbCl2
+ (b) CuCl2
+ (c) Ca(NO3)2
+ (d) BaSO4

## Precipitation Reactions: Make a Solid by Mixing Two Aqueous Solutions

+ *Precipitation reactions* are reactions in which a
solid forms when we mix two solutions.
  + Reactions between aqueous solutions of ionic compounds produce an ionic compound that is insoluble in water.
  + The insoluble product is called a *precipitate*.

## Precipitation of Lead(II) Iodide

+ 2 KI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → 2 KNO3(aq) + PbI(s)
+ (soluble) (soluble) (soluble) (insoluble)
+ When a potassium iodide solution is mixed with a lead(II) nitrate solution, a yellow lead(II) iodide precipitate forms.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-8d82e.png)

## No Precipitation Means No Chemical Reaction Has Occurred

+ Precipitation reactions do not always occur when two aqueous solutions are mixed.
  + Combine solutions of KI and NaCl and nothing happens.
  + KI(aq) + NaCl(aq) → No Reaction
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-70012.png)

## Predicting Precipitation Reactions

1. Determine what ions each of the aqueous reactants have.
2. Determine formulas of possible products.
  + Exchange (switch) ions.
    + Cation ((+) ion) from one reactant pairs up with the anion ((–) ion) from the other reactant
  + Balance charges of combined ions to get the formula of each product.
3. Determine the solubility of each product in water.
  + Use the solubility rules to determine if a product is insoluble or slightly soluble (e.g., it will precipitate) or if it forms a soluble compound.

## Predicting Precipitation Reactions: Continued

4. If products are insoluble, write their formulas as the products of the reaction using (s) after the formula to indicate solid. Write any soluble products with (aq) after the formula to indicate aqueous.
5. Balance the equation.

## Practice Problem: Writing Precipitation Equations

+ Write an equation for the precipitation reaction that occurs (if any) when you mix potassium carbonate and nickel (II) chloride

## Practice Problem: Writing Precipitation Equations

+ Write an equation for the precipitation reaction that occurs (if any) when you mix solutions of sodium nitrate and lithium sulfate.

## Representing Aqueous Reactions

+ An equation showing the *complete neutral formulas* for each compound in the aqueous reaction as if they existed as molecules is called a *molecular equation*.
+ 2 KOH(aq) + Mg(NO3)2(aq) → 2 KNO3(aq) + Mg(OH)2(s)
+ In actual solutions of soluble ionic compounds, dissolved substances are present as ions. Equations that describe the material’s structure when dissolved are called complete ionic equations.
+ 2 K+(aq) + 2 OH−(aq) + Mg2+(aq) + 2 NO3 −(aq) → 2 K+(aq) + 2 NO3 −(aq) + Mg(OH)2(s)

## Ionic Equation Rules

+ Rules of writing the complete ionic equation:
  + Aqueous (aq) strong electrolytes are written as ions.
    + Soluble salts, strong acids, strong bases
  + Insoluble substances, weak electrolytes, and nonelectrolytes are written in molecule form.
    + Solids (s), liquids (l), and gases (g) are not dissolved, this is why they are in a molecule form.
+ 2 K+(aq) + 2 OH−(aq) + Mg2+(aq) + 2 NO3 −(aq) →
  + 2 K+(aq) + 2 NO3 −(aq) + Mg(OH)2(s)

## Ionic Equation Writing

+ These ions are called *spectator ions* because they do not participate in the reaction.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-eab44.png)

## Net Ionic Equation

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-7b066.png)
+ When the spectator ions are removed, the chemical reaction is referred to as the *net ionic equation*.
  + 2 OH−(aq) + Mg2+(aq) → Mg(OH)2(s)
+ So a net ionic equation differs from a complete ionic equation because it does NOT have spectator ions in the equation.

## Acids

+ Acids are molecular compounds that form H+ when dissolved in water.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-a43c6.png)
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-0d511.png)
+ Acids are composed of hydrogen, usually written first in their formula, and one or more nonmetals, written second.
  + Examples:
    + HCl, H2SO4 , HNO3, CH3COOH
    + (acetic acid or vinegar)
+ Properties of acids:
  + Sour taste
  + Dissolve many metals such as Zn, Fe, Mg, but not Au, Ag, Pt

## Acid–Base Classification: Arrhenius

+ Simplest of Acid–Base Classification Arrhenius Definitions:
  + Acid: Substance that produces H+
  + HCl(aq) -> H+(aq) + Cl–(aq)
    + Polyprotic acids
      + These acids contain more than one ionizable proton and release them sequentially.
      + For example, sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a diprotic acid.
      + It is strong in its first ionizable proton, but weak in its second.
+ Base: Substance that produces OH− ions in aqueous solution
  + NaOH(aq) -> Na+(aq) + OH–(aq)

## Some Common Acids and Bases

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-c524f.png)

## Binary Acids and Oxyacids

+ Binary Acids:
  + Have H+1 cation and nonmetal anion
  + Example:
    + HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid, HF(aq) hydrofluoric acid
+ Oxyacids:
  + Have H+ cation and polyatomic anion
  + Example:
    + HNO3 (nitric acid), H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)
