## Oxidation–Reduction Reactions

+ The reactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to the other are called oxidation–reduction reactions.
  + These are also called redox reactions.
  + Many redox reactions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen.
  + Examples:
  + 2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g) (combustion)
  + 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)
  + 4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) (rusting)

## Oxidation and Reduction (Redox)

+ To convert a free element into an ion, the atoms must gain or lose electrons.
  + NOTE: If one atom loses electrons, another must accept them.
+ Atoms that *lose electrons* are being *oxidized*.
  + The reaction is referred to as *oxidation*.
+ Atoms that *gain electrons* are being *reduced*.
  + The reaction is referred to as *reduction*.
+ Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na → Na+ + 1 e– (oxidation; sodium lost electrons)
  +  Cl2 + 2 e– → 2 Cl– (reduction; chlorine atom gained electrons)

## Redox Reactions

+ Oxidation and reduction must occur simultaneously.
  + If an atom loses electrons, another atom must take them.
+ The reactant that reduces an element in another reactant is called the reducing agent.
  + The *reducing agent* contains the element that is oxidized.
+ The reactant that oxidizes an element in another reactant is called the *oxidizing agent*.
  + The oxidizing agent contains the element that is reduced.
+ Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
  + Na is oxidized, while Cl is reduced.
  + Na is the reducing agent, and Cl2 is the oxidizing agent.

## Oxidation States: “Electron Book Keeping”

+ For reactions that are not metal + nonmetal, or do not involve O2, a method for determining how the electrons are transferred is required to determine which element is being oxidized and which element is being reduced.
+ Chemists assign a number to each element in a reaction called an *oxidation state* that allows them to determine the electron flow in the reaction.
  + Even though they look like them, oxidation states are not ion charges!
    + Oxidation states are imaginary charges assigned based on a set of rules.
    + Ion charges are real, measurable charges.

## Rules for Assigning Oxidation States

+ The following rules are in order of priority:
1. Free elements have an oxidation state = 0.
  + Na = 0 and Cl2 = 0 in 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g)
2. Monatomic ions have an oxidation state equal to their charge.
  + Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl
3. (a) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound is 0.
  + Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl, (+1) + (−1) = 0

## Rules for Assigning Oxidation States Continued

3. (b) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a polyatomic ion equals the charge on the ion.
  + N = +5 and O = −2 in NO3 –, (+5) + 3(−2) = −1
4. (a) Group I metals have an oxidation state of +1 in all their compounds.
  + Na = +1 in NaCl
4. (b) Group II metals have an oxidation state of +2 in all their compounds.
  + Mg = +2 in MgCl2
5. In their compounds, nonmetals have oxidation states according to the following table.
  + Nonmetals higher on the table take priority.

## Practice Problem: Assigning Oxidation States

+ Assign an oxidation state to each atom in each element, ion or compound
(a) Cl2 (b) Na+ (c) KF (d) CO2 (e) SO4^2- (f) K2O2

## Identifying Redox Reactions

+ Oxidation: An increase in oxidation state
+ Reduction: A decrease in oxidation state
  + Carbon changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of +4.
    + Carbon loses electrons and is oxidized.
  + Sulfur changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of –2.
    + Sulfur gains electrons and is reduced.

## Redox Reaction

+ NOTE:
+ The transfer of electrons does not need to be a complete transfer (as
occurs in the formation of an ionic compound) for the reaction to
qualify as oxidation–reduction.
  + For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas:
    + H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)
+ When hydrogen bonds to chlorine, the electrons are unevenly shared, resulting in:
  + An increase of electron density (reduction) for chlorine
  + A decrease in electron density (oxidation) for hydrogen

## Combustion as Redox

+ 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)
+ Hydrogen and Oxygen reacts to form water in the gaseous state (steam).

## Practice Problem: Oxidation States and Identifying

+ What Is Being Oxidized and What Is Being Reduced Use oxidation state to identify the element that is oxidized
and the element that is reduced:
+ Mg(s) +2 H2O(l) à Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)

## Redox without Combustion

+ 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
+ Sodium metal transfers electrons to chlorine gas to form solid sodium chloride. The sodium metal is reduced and chlorine is oxidized.

## Practice Problem: Oxidation States and Identifying

+ What Is Being Oxidized and What Is Being Reduced
+ Determine whether or not each reaction is an oxidation-reduction reaction. For each oxidation-reduction reaction, identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent.
  + a) 2 Mg(s) + O2(g) à 2 MgO(s)
  + b) 2HBr(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) à 2 H2O(l) + CaBr2(aq)
  + c) Zn(s) + Fe2+(aq) à Zn2+(aq) + Fe(s)
