  + Troubles
  + If you are still experiencing error messages, the problem is probably with your browser
    + Try clearing your cache and cookies
  + If your lab TA e-mails you that you can't come to lab because you can't use the homework site you will not be able to come
    + But if you follow "procedure" (not sure what procedure) you will be allowed to come (assuming the problem is actually with the Pearson site)

## Test 1

+ Next Wednesday in our usual classroom at 6:30 PM
  + All you should bring is a pencil, calculator, and photo-ID
  + Try to get here close to time
    + If you forget your photo ID, it's fixable, but a nuisance
  + Can't leave the test before 7:05 PM even if you get through at 6:31 PM
  + Should know all the constants we've used and the three formulas we've used
  + Audio 0:09:21.043687
    + Anything in chapters 1, 2, or 3
  + Not all of chapter 3 will be on the test

# Chapter 3 - Part 2


## “Black Body Problem” Solved by Planck in 1900

+ Audio 0:12:13.134181
+ "... an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics ..."
+ Energy (light) is emitted or absorbed in discrete units (quantum).
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-a2326.png)
  + Audio 0:12:39.255151
  + "One of the 7 or 8 numbers that define our universe"
+ "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it..."

## Mystery 2, “Photoelectric Effect” Solved by Einstein in 1905

+ Audio 0:13:59.822330
+ "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect” 1921
  + Light has both:
  1. wave nature
  2. particle nature
+ Photon is a “particle” of light
  + Audio 0:15:56.294916
  + Photo electrons are emitted as soon as you turn the light on is explained by the photon description
+ Predicted that KE would be linearly dependent upon frequency
+ hv = KE + BE
+ KE = hv - BE

## Example

+ Audio 0:16:45.896720

+ When copper is bombarded with high-energy electrons, X rays are emitted. Calculate the energy (in joules) associated with the photons if the wavelength of the X rays is 0.154 nm

## Clicker Question

+ Audio 0:22:58.445126
+ A photon has a wavelength of 624 nm. Calculate the energy of the photon in joules
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-0fb66.png)
+ Are there any extra reviews before the test?
  + Audio 0:27:22.163854
  + Some of Wednesday's lecture will be review
  + Also, there's practice on the MyLabsPlus website

## Emission Spectra

+ Audio 0:28:51.812590
+ ![Emission spectra](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-d8c48.png)
+ Light had been thought of as a wave for a long time and now it's being thought of as particles
  + People were asking why is light emitted and absorbed in fixed quantities?

## Examples of Spectra

+ Audio 0:30:24.253251
+ ![Examples of spectra](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-89007.png)
+ Each element has its own emission spectrum
+ All of this points to atoms emitting and absorbing light / energy in discrete packets

## The Bohr Model of the Atom

+ Audio 0:31:23.054768
+ The nuclear model of the atom (Rutherford model) does not explain what structural changes occur when the atom gains or loses energy.
  + He hypothesized that only certain orbits are allowed and came up with a model which predicted what was observed
+ Bohr developed a model of the atom to explain how the structure of the atom changes when it undergoes energy transitions.
+ Bohr’s major idea was that the energy of the atom was quantized, and that the amount of energy in the atom was related to the electron’s position in the atom.
  + Quantized means that the atom could have only very specific amounts of energy.


## Bohr’s Model

+ Audio 0:32:22.750198
+ The electrons travel in orbits that are at a fixed distance from the nucleus.
  + Found different shapes of orbits
  + Stationary states
  + Therefore, the energy of the electron was proportional to the distance the orbit was from the nucleus.
+ Electrons emit radiation when they “jump” from an orbit with higher energy down to an orbit with lower energy.
  + Audio 0:32:58.969212
  + The emitted radiation was a photon of light.
  + The distance between the orbits determined the energy of the photon of light produced.

## Bohr Model of H Atoms

+ Audio 0:33:26.216675
+ Shows how particles jump orbits

## Bohr's Model of the Atom (1913)

+ Audio 0:33:46.737388
1. e- can only have specific (quantized) energy values
2. light is emitted as e- and moves from one energy level to a lower energy level
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-08ac8.png)
+ n (principal quantum number) = 1,2,3,...
+ RH (Rydberg constant) = 2.18 x 10-18J
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-c6959.png)

## Weakness' of Bohr's Model

+ Audio 0:35:34.154227
+ Only worked for Hydrogen, Li 2+, and Be 3+
+ Only for a nucleus and one electron
+ When charges are forced through curved path they emit radiation (Bermsstrahlung) so "orbits around nuclei are unstable"

## Wave Behavior Properties: Interference

+ Audio 0:36:55.247976
+ Einstein says light has wave and particle properties
+ Now we think maybe particles have wave properties
+ The interaction between waves (e.g., electromagnetic, ocean) is called interference.
+ Interference Types:
  + Constructive interference: waves that interact so that they make a larger wave are said to be in phase
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-0d338.png)
  + Destructive interference: Waves that interact so that they cancel each other out are said to be out of phase
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-9772a.png)

## Two-Slit Interference

+ Audio 0:38:15.810042
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-a7667.png)
+ Diffraction pattern
  + Either it goes through a slit or it doesn't

## Wave Behavior Properties: Diffraction

+ Audio 0:38:41.975443
+ When traveling waves encounter an obstacle or opening in a barrier that is about the same size as the wavelength, they bend around it; this is called diffraction.
  + Traveling particles do not diffract
+ The diffraction of light through two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wavelength results in an interference pattern of the diffracted waves.
+ An interference pattern is a characteristic of all light waves.

## Wave Behavior of Electrons

+ Audio 0:39:38.320960
+ De Broglie proposed that particles could have wavelike character.
+ De Broglie predicted that the wavelength of a particle was inversely proportional to its momentum.
+ Because it is so small, the wave character of electrons is significant.
+ De Broglie relation
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-02-week-3-day-3-afe2d.png)

## Example problem

+ Audio 0:40:32.639227
+ What are the de Broglie wavelengths (in nm) associated with an electron traveling at 6.0 * 10^5 ms-1 and a 52.5 g Ping-Pong ball traveling at 15.6 m/s?
