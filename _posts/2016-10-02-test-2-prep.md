title: Test 2 Prep
---

Test 2 is on chapters 4 - 6. Here are my suggestions for preparing for the exam. Look at the notes for weeks 5 - 8.

+ Work Recitation Questions
  + [Recitation from Week 5](https://jmbeach.github.io/CH101-008/2016/09/21/week-5-recitation-1st-for-test-2.html)
  + I will try to get Week 6's up tonight or tomorrow.
  + Week 7, Dr. Bakker was sick
+ Work the clicker questions from lectures from weeks 5 - 8
+ [Study these Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/ch-101-test-2)
  + This includes the names of compounds you need to know from Chapter 5.
+ Work the problems at the end of chapters 4 - 6 and post questions to our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1808499582716052/).

Good luck on the exam!
