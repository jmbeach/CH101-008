Test 2 is on chapters 4 - 6. Here are my suggestions for preparing for the exam. Look at the notes for weeks 4 - 8.

+ Work Recitation Questions
  + [Recitation from Week 5](https://jmbeach.github.io/CH101-008/2016/09/21/week-5-recitation-1st-for-test-2.html)
  + [Recitation from Week 6](https://jmbeach.github.io/CH101-008/2016/09/21/week-6-recitation-2nd-for-test-2.html)
  + [Recitation from Week 7](https://jmbeach.github.io/CH101-008/2016/10/05/test-2-recitation-3.html)
+ Work the clicker questions from lectures from weeks 4 - 8
+ [Study these Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/ch-101-test-2)
  + This includes the names of compounds you need to know from Chapter 5.
    + [Notes from this day](https://jmbeach.github.io/CH101-008/2016/09/21/week-6-day-2.html)
    + [Quizlet on the names](https://quizlet.com/_2jbzxn)
      + This is table 5.5 in your book
  + Also includes the molecular shapes we need to know from chapter 6

+ Work the problems at the end of chapters 4 - 6 and post questions to our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1808499582716052/).
+ Yet another resource is the practice quiz portion of the homework website
  + It is under Study Area

      + Click "Access the Study Area"
    + In the window that appears, set the chapter to 4, 5, or 6 and then choose the "Practice Test" link
