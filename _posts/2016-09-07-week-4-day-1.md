## Trajectory Vs Probability

+ Audio 0:21:20.562074
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-07-week-4-day-1-35a6e.png)
  + If you know the forces acting on an object with classical trajectory, you can tell exactly where it will land
  + With electrons, you can only know with a degree of certainty where it will be

## Uncertainty Principle Demonstration

## Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

+ Heisenberg stated that the product of the uncertainties in both the position and speed of a particle was inversely proportional to its mass.
  + x = position, Δx = uncertainty in position
  + v= velocity, Δv = uncertainty in velocity
  + m=mass
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-07-week-4-day-1-0243d.png)
+ This means that the more accurately you know the position of a small particle, such as an electron, the less you know about its speed, and vice versa.

+ Stopped short for practice questions

## Q1

+ An element has three stable isotopes with masses of 27.977 amu, 28.976 amu, and 29.973 amu. The heavier two isotopes have an abundance of 4.68 % and 3.09 %. What is the atomic mass of the element?

## Q2

+ Rank in order of increasing mass
  + proton < neutron < electron
  + proton < electron < neutron
  + electron < neutron < proton
  + electron < proton < neutron

(answer is C)

## Q3

+ How many protons, neutrons, and electrons are in isotope ^65_28X
  + 36 neutrons, 29 protons, and 29 electrons

## Q4

When waves of equal amplitude from two sources are in phase when they interact, it is called => constructive interference

## Q5

What is the frequency of an electron with wavelength 486.1 nm?
