## Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecules and Ions

+ Audio 0:20:09.219234
+ When the combining atomic orbitals are identical and of equal energy, the contribution of each atomic orbital to the molecular orbital is equal.
+ When the combining atomic orbitals are different types and energies, contributions to the MOs are different:
+ The more electronegative an atom is, the lower in energy are its orbitals.
+ Lower energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the bonding MOs.
+ Higher energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the antibonding MOs.
+ Nonbonding MOs remain localized on the atom donating its atomic orbitals.

## MO and Polyatomic Molecules

+ Audio 0:26:43.466301
+ When many atoms are combined together, the atomic
orbitals of all the atoms are combined to make a set of
molecular orbitals, which are delocalized over the entire
molecule.
+ Gives results that better match real molecule properties than either Lewis or valence bond theories

## Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors

+ Audio 0:32:35.553208
+ The simplest theory of metallic bonding involves the metal atoms releasing their valence electrons to be shared as a pool by all the atoms/ ions in the metal.
 + An organization of metal cation islands in a sea of electrons
 + Electrons delocalized throughout the metal structure
+ Bonding results from attraction of cation for the delocalized electrons.

## Semiconductors and Band Theory

+ Audio 0:35:46.508773
+ Band Theory:
+ Electrons become mobile when they make a transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital into higher energy empty molecular orbitals.
+ These occupied molecular orbitals are referred to as the valence band.
+ The unoccupied orbitals the conduction band.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-628e3.png)
  + silicon is an insulator because it has a large energy gap between the valence band to the conduction band of orbitals
  + conductors have no gap
+ Audio 0:37:16.124083
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-48d05.png)
  + Bigger the gap, the less conduction
    + The funny thing is that silicon is the thing we use for conduction in transistors
      + We add stuff
+ Audio 0:38:21.396460
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-c961e.png)
  + We add a little boron and it gives an empty orbital between the valence and the conduction bonds and allows for conduction
    + They can hop into the empty orbital

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| (lower or higher?) energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the bonding MOs | lower |
| (lower or higher?) energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the antibonding MOs | higher |
| band | when many orbitals are present, their energy difference becomes relatively small and we refer to them as this |
