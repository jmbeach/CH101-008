# Chapter 1 Notes Part 2

## Classification of Pure Substances

+ Pure substances can be categorized into two types:
  + Elements
  + Compounds
+ This categorization depends on whether or not they can be broken down (or decomposed) into simpler substances.
+ An *element* is a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.
  + Basic building blocks of matter
  + Composed of single type of atom, like helium
+ A *compound* is a substance composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions.
+ Most elements are chemically reactive and combine with other elements to form compounds.

## Heterogeneous Mixture

+ A *heterogeneous mixture* is one in which the composition varies from one region of the mixture to another.
  + Made of multiple substances, whose presence can be seen (example: a salt and sand mixture)
    + Portions of a sample of a heterogeneous mixture have different composition and properties.

## Homogeneous Mixture

+ A *homogeneous mixture* is one made of multiple substances, but it appears to be one substance.
+ All portions of a sample have the same composition and properties (like sweetened tea).
+ Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly.

## The Scientific Approach to Knowledge

+ Audio 0:12:42.707245
+  The approach to scientific knowledge is empirical
  +  It is based on observation and experimentation.
+ The scientific method is a process for understanding nature by observing nature and its behavior through experimentation.
+ Key characteristics of the scientific method
  + Observations
  + Formulation of hypotheses
  + Experimentation
  + Formulation of laws and theories

## Observations

+ Observations:
  + They are also known as data.
  + They are the descriptions about the characteristics or behavior of nature.
+ Observations, verification of observations, and experimentation can lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis.

## The Scientific Approach to Knowledge

+ Scientists try to understand the universe through empirical knowledge gained through observation and experiment

## Gathering Empirical Knowledge ─ Observation

+  Some observations are descriptions of the characteristics or behavior of nature ─ qualitative
+  Some observations compare a characteristic to a standard numerical scale ─ quantitative

## From Observation to Understanding

+ Audio 0:15:58.585935
+  Hypothesis – a tentative interpretation or explanation for an observation
+  A good hypothesis is one that can be tested to be proved wrong!

## Testing Ideas

+ Audio 0:17:57.155168
+ Ideas in science are tested with experiments
+ An experiment is a set of highly controlled procedures designed to test whether an idea about nature is valid
+ The experiment generates observations that will either validate or invalidate the idea

## Is this a good hypothesis?

+ Audio 0:19:00.330922
+ Yesterday, the phase of the moon was a crescent. I observed that it rained a lot yesterday.
+ It also rained during the previous crescent moon.
+ I hypothesize that crescent moons cause rain showers
  + The hypothesis is the 'why?'
+ My answer: This is a good hypothesis because it can be tested and proved wrong
+ Audio 0:21:04.453540
+ Best answer: C
  + It's a good hypothesis because it's falsifiable
  + Audio 0:23:23.754722
  + Audio 0:25:56.261455
  + Good reasons to understand the importance of hypothesis

## From Specific to General Understanding

+ Audio 0:26:25.458523
+ A *hypothesis* is a potential explanation for a single or small number of observations
+ A *scientific theory* is a general explanation for why things in nature are the way they are and behave the way they do
  + Integrates a lot of different observations
  + Lets us predict what's happening in the universe

## Think about it

+ Given what you just learned about the term “Theory”, what’s wrong with this statement:
  + “The theory of gravity is just a theory and therefore probably wrong”
    + Audio 0:27:55.076377
    + By the time you get to calling things theories, they have been tested *a lot*
      + The scientific method says you can't prove anything, you can only disprove things
      + You'll have to explain exceptions to the theory at some point so a new theory will emerge

## From Specific to General Observations

+ A *scientific law* is a statement that summarizes all past observations and predicts future observations
  + *Law of Conservation of Mass* – “In a chemical reaction matter is neither created nor destroyed.”
+ A scientific law allows you to predict future observations

## Relationships Between Pieces of the Scientific Method

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-08-19-week-1-day-2-9652f.png)

## The Scientific Approach to Knowledge

+ It is necessary to be careful with the information presented by an experimentalist who lacks theoretical principles... [he] gathers at random several facts and presents them as proofs... scientific knowledge without reasoning [theory] does not exist.”
  + J. le R. d’Alembert (1717-1783), from Nouvelles Experiences sur la Resistance des Fluids. Jombert, Paris (1997)
+ D'Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ....Unfortunately he carried [his]... pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong...
  + Thomas L. Hankins (1990). Jean D'Alembert: Science and the Enlightenment. Taylor & Francis. p. 236. ISBN 2881243991

## Why Is Scientific Measurement Important?
+ Scientific data can be either qualifiable or quantifiable
  + Qualifiable data are observational
    + Subjective in nature
    + Examples: color, shape
+ Quantifiable data are measurable (empirical).
  + Objective in nature
  + Uses equipment (e.g., glassware, balance, instrumentation) capable of generating empirical data with standardized *UNITS*.
    + English system (e.g., inch, feet, etc.) – International System of Units (SI)
    + Metric system

## What Is a Measurement?

+ Audio 0:36:17.268476
+ quantitative observation
+ comparison to an agreed- upon standard
+ every measurement has a number and a unit
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-08-19-week-1-day-2-bae0e.png)

## Significant Figures

+ Audio 0:37:46.810624
+ No measurement can be more accurate than half the smallest division
  + Note: Tro says 1/10 of smallest division
+ Often write +- to indicate this: 11+-1 mm, 1.1 +-0.3 cm
+ No error range given? Then assume + half the least Significant Figure
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-08-19-week-1-day-2-5c1b1.png)
+ Audio 0:39:46.713576
+ Any digit that is not zero is significant
  + 1.234 kg 4 significant figures
+ Zeros between nonzero digits are significant
  + 606 m 3 significant figures
+ Zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit are not significant
  + 0.08 L 1 significant figure
+ If a number is greater than 1, then all zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant
  + 2.0 mg 2 significant figures
+ If a number is less than 1, then only the zeros that are at the end and in the middle of the number are significant
  + 0.004020 g 4 significant figures
+ [test your ability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic-home/arith-review-decimals/arithmetic-significant-figures-tutorial/e/significant_figures_1)

## How many significant figures are in each of the following measurements?

+ Audio 0:42:44.871665
+ 24 mL
  + 2
+ 3001 g
  + 4
+ 0.0320 m^3
  + 3
+ 6.4 x 104 molecules
  + 2
+ 560 kg
  + 2

## Rounding Rules for Significant Figures

+ Audio 0:44:53.580413
+ Digit being rounded > 5
  + Add 1 to least significant digit
  + Result: 4.16 with 2 sig figs becomes 4.2
+ Digit being rounded < 5
  + Result: 4.14 with 2 sig figs becomes 4.1
+ ROUND AT THE END OF THE PROBLEM

## Addition or Subtraction - Significant Figures

+ The answer cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than any of the original numbers
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-08-19-week-1-day-2-c7ef7.png)
    + 1.1 has one sig fig after decimal
    + round 90.432 to 90.4
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-08-19-week-1-day-2-6e28c.png)
+ Look at sig figs in the given variables in the problem and have that many in your answer
