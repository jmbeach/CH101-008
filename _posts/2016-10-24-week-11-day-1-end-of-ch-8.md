## Alkali Metal Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Audio 0:07:08.868545
+ Overview of Alkali Metals:
+ The alkali metals (group 1A) have ns1 outer electron configurations.
  + Form +1 cation to “achieve” noble gas configuration.
+ The reactions of the alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous.
+ Common reaction for alkali metals (M) is with halogens (X)
  + 2 M + X2 → 2 MX
  + Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)
+ The alkali metals react vigorously with water to form the dissolved alkali metal ion, the hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas:
  + 2 M(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 M+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq) + H2(g)
  + The reaction is highly exothermic and can be explosive because the heat from the reaction can ignite the hydrogen gas.

## Halogen Reaction: A Type of Chemical Reaction

+ Audio 0:09:58.472842
+ Halogen Overview:
+ Group 7 elements that have ns2np5 outer electron configurations:
  + Mostly form –1 anions (F only forms –1 anion) to achieve the “noble gas configuration”
  + Most reactive of the nonmetal elements
+ The halogens (X) tend to react with metals especially with Group 1 and 2A metals to form ionic compounds such as metal halides (MXn).
  + 2 M + n X2 → 2 MXn
  + Example: 2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) → 2 FeCl3(s)
+ The halogens react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.
  + H2( g) + X2 → 2 HX(g)

+ Two samples of calcium and fluoride are decomposed into their constituent elements. The first sample showed that the yield of products was 100% (really!). If the second sample produced 294 mg of fluorine, how many g of calcium were formed? (Ca: 40.08, F: 19.00)
  + A) 0.280 g
  + B) 3.10 * 10^2 g
  + C) 3.13 g
  + D) 0.310 g
  + E) 2.80 * 10^2 g

# Chapter 9

+ Introduction to Solutions & Aqueous Reactions

## Why a whole “introductory” chapter on chemistry in water?

+ Audio 0:18:22.136923
+ Water is ubiquitous: human body is 50-65% water
+ Water is (relatively) cheap
+ Water is a good solvent
+ Many reactions go faster in water

## Solution Concentration and Solution Stoichiometry

+ Audio 0:20:23.634573
+ When table salt is mixed with water, it seems to
disappear or become a liquid, and the mixture is
homogeneous.
  + The salt is still there, as you can tell from the taste or simply boiling away the water.
+ Homogeneous mixtures are called *solutions*.
+ The component of the solution that changes state is
called the *solute*.
+ The component that keeps its state is called the solvent.

## Solution Concentration: Categories

+ Audio 0:22:26.471631
+ *Dilute solutions* have a small amount of solute compared to solvent.
+ Concentrated solutions have a large amount of solute compared to solvent
+ Can also describe Quantitatively

## OLD Solution Concentration: Molality

+ A (not so) common way to express a solution concentration is molality (M).
  + *Molality* is the amount of solute (in moles) divided by the mass of solvent (in kg). CH102

## Solution Concentration: Molarity

+ Audio 0:23:35.675700
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-63cb4.png)

## Solution Concentration: Molarity

+ Audio 0:25:57.189268
+ A common way to express a solution concentration is molarity (M).
  + Molarity is the amount of solute (in moles) divided by the volume of solution (in liters).
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-10-10-remainder-of-ch-7-1e9a9.png)

## Using Molarity in Calculations

+ Audio 0:26:25.553273
+ The molarity of a solution can be used as a conversion
factor between moles of the solute and liters of the
solution.
  + For example: A 0.500 M NaCl solution contains 0.500 mol NaCl for every liter of solution.

## Practice Problem: Calculating Concentrations

+ Audio 0:28:53.770758
+ What is the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 25.5 g of KBr in enough water to give 1.75 L of solution?

## Clicker 2

+ Audio 0:32:28.311372
+ Determine the molarity of a solution formed by dissolving 97.7 g LiBr in enough water to yield 750.0 mL of solution. (Li: 6.941, Br: 79.90)
  + A) 1.50 M
  + B) 1.18 M
  + C) 0.130 M
  + D) 0.768 M
  + E) 2.30 M

## Solution Dilution: Making a Solution from a Solution: C1·V1 = C2·V2

+ Audio 0:37:43.525017
+ A dilution is when a new solution is prepared from a stock solution (more concentrated solution).
+ To make solutions of lower concentrations from these stock solutions, more solvent is added.
  + The amount of solute doesn’t change; just the volume of solution changes:
    + moles solute in solution 1 = moles solute in solution 2
    + The concentrations and volumes of the stock and new solutions are inversely proportional.
+ The mathematical relationship is C1·V1 = C2·V2,
or if the concentration unit is Molarity, then it can be written as M1·V1 = M2·V2.
