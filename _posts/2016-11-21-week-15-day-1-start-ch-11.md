## Gas Pressure

+ Audio 0:07:39.758980
+ Gas pressure is a result of the constant movement of the gas molecules and their collisions with the surfaces around them.
+ The pressure of a gas depends on several factors:
  + Number of gas particles in a given volume
  + Volume of the container
  + Average speed of the gas particles
  + Mass of the gas particles

## Gas Pressure

+ The total pressure exerted by a gas depends on frequency of collisions & momentum change during a collision:
+ Number of gas particles in a given volume
  + The fewer the gas particles, the lower the force per unit area and the lower the pressure.
    + A low density of gas particles results in low pressure. A high density of gas particles results in high pressure.
    + As volume increases, concentration of gas molecules decreases (number of molecules does not change, but since the volume increases, the concentration goes down).
      + This, in turn, results in fewer molecular collisions, which results in lower pressure.
+ Momentum of individual molecules
  + speed and mass of molecules
    + Temperature

## Atmospheric Pressure Effects

+ Audio 0:10:36.762960
+ Variation in pressure in Earthʼ s atmosphere creates wind, and changes in pressure help us to predict weather.
  + The H in this map indicates regions of high pressure, usually associated with clear weather.
  + The L indicates regions of low pressure, usually associated with unstable weather.
+ The number of gas particles in a given volume decreases with increasing altitude.
  + Hence, pressure decreases with increasing altitude.

## Pressure Imbalance in the Ear

+ Audio 0:11:41.834490
+ If there is a difference in pressure across the eardrum membrane, the membrane will be pushed out.
  + The result is what we commonly call a “popped eardrum.”

## Pressure Units

+ Audio 0:13:12.088425
+ Common units of pressure:
  + Millimeter of mercury (Hg)
+ mmHg
  + Torr
+ Same as millimeter of mercury
  + Atmosphere (atm)
+ Conversion between pressure units:
  + 1 mmHg = 1 torr
  + 760 mmHg = 1 atm
  + 760 torr = 1 atm

## The Manometer

+ Audio 0:18:10.818952
+ The pressure of a gas trapped in a container can be measured with an instrument called a manometer.
+ Manometers are U-shaped tubes partially filled with a liquid that are connected to the gas sample on one side and open to the air on the other.
+ A competition is established between the pressures of the atmosphere and the gas.
  + The difference in the liquid levels is a measure of the difference in pressure between the gas and the atmosphere.
+ For this sample, the gas pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure; the mercury level on the left side of the tube is higher than the level on the right.

## Basic Properties of Gases

+ Audio 0:20:54.286850
+ There are four basic properties of a gas:
  + Pressure (P)
    + Units in atmosphere (atm)
  + Volume (V)
    + Units in liters (L)
  + Temperature (T)
    + Units in Kelvin (K)
      + Where Kelvin (K) = Celsius T + 273
  + Amount in moles (n)
+ These properties are interrelated.
  + When one changes, it affects the others.
    + The simple gas laws describe the relationships between pairs of these properties.

## The Simple Gas Laws

+ Audio 0:23:11.105305
+ The simple gas laws are as follows:
  + Boyleʼs Law
+ Investigates pressure and volume relationship
  + Charlesʼs Law
+ Investigates volume and temperature relationship
  + Avogadroʼs Law
+ Investigates volume and amount (mole) relationship

## Boyleʼs Law: Volume and Pressure

+ Audio 0:25:25.284216
+ Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and Robert Hooke used a J-tube to measure the volume of a sample of gas at different pressures.
+ They trapped a sample of air in the J-tube and added mercury to increase the pressure on the gas.
  + They observed an inverse relationship between volume and pressure.
+ Hence, an increase in one causes a decrease in the other.
+ Inverse Relationship As the volume of a gas sample is decreased, gas molecules collide with surrounding surfaces more frequently, resulting in greater pressure. A plot of the volume of a gas versus pressure. The plot shows that volume and pressure are inversely related.
+ Pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume when temperature and the amount of gas are held constant.
  + As P increases, V decreases by the same factor.
  + P × V = constant
+ Graphing Boyle’s Law
  + A graph of P versus V results in a curve.
  + A graph of P versus 1/V results in a straight line plot.
+ Relationship:
  + P1 × V1 = P2 × V2

## Boyleʼs Law and Diving

+ Audio 0:26:17.106941
+ For every 10 m of depth, a diver experiences approximately one additional atmosphere of pressure due to the weight of the surrounding water.
  + At 20 m, for example, the diver experiences approximately 3 atm of pressure.
+ If a diver holds his or her breath and rises to the surface quickly, the outside pressure drops to 1 atm.
  + According to Boyleʼs law, what should happen to the volume of air in the lungs?
+ Because the pressure is decreasing by a factor of 3, the volume will expand by a factor of 3, causing damage to internal organs.
+ Always exhale when rising!

## Clicker 2

+ What volume (in mL) will a sample of F2 gas occupy in a syringe at 5.5 atm, if the F2 has a volume of 25.0 mL at 1.2 atm?
  + A) 11 mL
  + B) 17 mL
  + C) 3.8 mL
  + D) 5.5 mL
  + E) 7.6 mL

## Charlesʼs Law: Volume and Temperature Have a Direct Relationship

+ Audio 0:32:43.927172
+ The volume of a fixed amount of gas at a constant pressure increases linearly with increasing temperature in kelvins.
  + Volume and temperature have a direct relationship
+ if the volume of a gas increases with increasing temperature.
+ V = constant × T (T measured in kelvins)
+ V/T = constant
+ (V1/T1) = (V2/T2)

## Charlesʼs Law: Graphically

+ Audio 0:34:58.249430
+ The extrapolated lines cannot be measured experimentally because all gases condense into liquids before –273.15 °C is reached.
+ If the lines are extrapolated back to a volume of 0, they all show the same temperature, −273.15 °C = 0 K, called *absolute zero*.

## Charlesʼs Law: A Molecular View

+ When the temperature of a gas sample increases, the gas particles move faster.
  + Collisions with the walls are more frequent.
  + The force exerted with each collision is greater.
+ The only way for the pressure (the force per unit area) to remain constant is for the gas to occupy a larger volume so that collisions become less frequent and occur over a larger area.
+ If a filled balloon is moved from an ice water bath to a boiling water bath, its volume expands as the gas particles within the balloon move faster (due to the increased temperature) and collectively occupy more space.

## Clicker 3

+ Audio 0:37:40.527989
+ To what temperature must a balloon, initially at 25 C and 2.00 L, be heated in order to have a volume of 6.00L?
  + A) 993 K
  + B) 403 K
  + C) 75 K
  + D) 655 K
  + E) 894 K
