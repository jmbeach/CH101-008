  + the probability of finding an electron at a particular point in space
  + for s orbital: maximum at the nucleus?
  + decreases as you move away from the nucleus
+ the Radial Distribution function represents the total probability at a certain distance from the nucleus
  + maximum at most probable radius
+ *nodes* in the functions are where the probability drops to 0

+ Subshell – electrons with the same values of n and l
+ Orbital – electrons with the same values of n, l, and ml
+ How many electrons can an orbital hold?
  + If n,l,and ml are fixed,then ms =1/2or-1/2 Ψ= (n, l, ml, 1/2)orΨ= (n, l, ml, -1/2)

## Energy of orbitals in a single electron atom

+ Audio 0:39:54.807493

## Coulomb's Law

+ Audio 0:41:07.948707
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-12-week-5-day-1-10d5b.png)
+ Coulomb’s law describes the attractions and repulsions between charged particles.
  + For like charges, the potential energy (E) is positive and decreases as the particles get farther apart as r increases.
  + For opposite charges, the potential energy is negative and becomes more negative as the particles get closer together.
  + The strength of the interaction increases as the size of the charges increases.
    + Electrons are more strongly attracted to a nucleus with a 2+ charge than to a nucleus with a 1+ charge.

## Penetration & Shielding

+ Audio 0:42:15.187414
![](../../../assets/2016-09-12-week-5-day-1-feeb8.png)
+ Audio 0:43:45.128001
+ From radial distribution function: 2s orbital penetrates more deeply
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-12-week-5-day-1-8d592.png)
into 1s orbital than does 2p
+ the weaker penetration => electrons in the 2p sublevel experience more repulsive force & are more shielded from nucleus (less attractive force)
+ =>electrons in 2s sublevel lower E than in 2p
+ Penetration causes the energies of sublevels in the same principal level to not be degenerate.
+ In the fourth and fifth principal levels, the effects of penetration become so important that the s orbital lies lower in energy than the d orbitals of the previous principal level.
+ The energy separations between one set of orbitals and the next become smaller beyond the 4s orbital.
  + The ordering can therefore vary among elements, causing variations in the electron configurations of the transition metals and their ions.

## General Energy Ordering of Orbitals for Multi-electron Atoms

## Electron configurations

+ Electron configuration is how the electrons are distributed among the various atomic orbitals in an atom.
