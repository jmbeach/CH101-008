## Daltonʼs Law of Partial Pressures

+ Audio 0:12:15.535453
+ For a multicomponent gas mixture, we calculate the partial pressure of each component from the ideal gas law and the number of moles of that component (nn) as follows:

+ The sum of the partial pressures of the components in a gas mixture equals the total pressure:

## Mole Fraction: χa

+ Audio 0:13:15.434990
+ The number of moles of a component in a mixture divided by the total number of moles in the mixture is the *mole fraction*.

## Deep-Sea Diving and Partial Pressures

+ Audio 0:22:33.181580
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-7fb10.png)
+ When a diver breathes compressed air, the abnormally high partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs leads to an elevated concentration of oxygen in body tissues.

## Collecting Gases

+ Audio 0:22:51.487861
+ Gases are often collected by having them displace water from a container.
  – The problem is that because water evaporates, there is also water vapor in the collected gas.
+ The partial pressure of the water vapor, called the vapor pressure, depends only on the temperature.
  – A table can be used to find the partial pressure of the water vapor when collecting a gas over water.
  – Example:
    + A gas sample is collected over water. The gas sample has a total pressure of 758.2 mmHg at 25 °C.
    + From a *vapor pressure* of water table, the partial pressure of the water vapor is 23.78 mmHg at 25 oC.
    + The partial pressure of the dry gas will be 734.4 mmHg.

## Vapor Pressure of Water

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-d10e0.png)

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

+ Audio 0:25:29.060382
+ The simplest model for the behavior of gases is the *kinetic molecular theory*.
+ In this theory, a gas is modeled as a collection of particles (either molecules or atoms, depending on the gas) in constant motion.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-d89af.png)

## Kinetic Molecular Theory Postulates

+ The particles of the gas (either atoms or molecules) are constantly moving.
+ The attraction between particles are neglected.
+ When the moving gas particles hit another gas particle or the container, they do not stick; they bounce off and continue moving in another direction.
+ There is a lot of empty space between the gas particles compared to the size of the particles.

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-1161d.png)

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

+ The collision of one particle with another (or with the walls of its container) is completely elastic.
  – This means that when two particles collide, they may exchange energy, but there is no overall loss of energy.
    + Any kinetic energy lost by one particle is completely gained by the other.
+ The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature.
  – As you raise the temperature of the gas, the average speed of the particles increases.
    + But not all the gas particles are moving at the same speed!

## The Nature of Pressure

+ Because the gas particles are constantly moving, they strike the sides of the container with a force.
+ The result of many particles in a gas sample exerting forces on the surfaces around them is a constant pressure.
  + Pressure (P) = Force (F)/Area (A)

## Gas Laws Explain Boyleʼs Law

+ Boyleʼs law says that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure.
  – Decreasing the volume forces the molecules into a smaller space.
+ More molecules will collide with the container at any one instant, increasing the pressure.

## Gas Laws Explain Charlesʼs Law

+ Charlesʼs law says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
  – According to kinetic molecular theory, when we increase the temperature of a gas, the average speed—and thus the average kinetic energy—of the particles increases.
+ The greater volume spreads the collisions out over a greater surface area, so that the pressure is unchanged.

## Gas Laws Explain Avogadroʼs Law

+ Audio 0:27:49.912122
+ Avogadroʼs law says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules.
+ Increasing the number of gas molecules causes more of them to hit the wall at the same time.
+ To keep the pressure constant, the volume must then increase.

## Gas Laws Explain Daltonʼs Law

+ Audio 0:28:02.848774
+ Daltonʼs law says that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures.
+ According to kinetic molecular theory, the particles have negligible size and they do not interact.
  – Particles of different masses have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature.
+ Because the average kinetic energy is the same, the total pressure of the collisions is the same.

## Temperature and Molecular Velocities

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-3f092.png)

## Molecular Speed versus Molar Mass

+ Audio 0:33:13.886790
• To have the same average kinetic energy, heavier molecules must have a slower average speed.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-800f6.png)

## Temperature versus Molecular Speed

+ Audio 0:33:55.441736
• As the temperature of a gas sample increases, the velocity distribution of the molecules shifts toward higher velocity.
– The distribution function “spreads out,” resulting in more molecules with faster speeds.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-d32c3.png)

## Mean Free Path

+ Audio 0:34:47.342762
+ Molecules in a gas travel in straight lines until they collide with another molecule or the container.
+ The average distance a molecule travels between collisions is called the *mean free path*.
+ Mean free path decreases as the pressure increases.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-55ee8.png)

## Diffusion

+ Audio 0:35:31.009397
+ The process of a collection of molecules spreading out from high concentration to low concentration is called *diffusion*.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-8889b.png)

## Diffusion and Effusion

+ Audio 0:36:50.045677
+ The process by which a collection of molecules escapes through a small hole into a vacuum is called *effusion*.
+ The rates of diffusion and effusion of a gas are both related to the root mean square (rms) velocity of the gas particles.
+ For gases at the same temperature, this means that the rate of gas movement is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-0f63c.png)

## Grahamʼs Law of Effusion

+ The ratio of the rates of effusion of two different gases at the same temperature is given by the following equation:
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-30-week-16-day-2-b1ee4.png)

## Clicker 3

+ Audio 0:39:33.577535
+ The rate of effusion of oxygen
