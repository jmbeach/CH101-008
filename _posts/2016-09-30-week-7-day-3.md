# Ch 6 continued (pt 2)

## Example: Formal Charge, SO2

+ Audio 0:06:38.049121
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-30-week-7-day-3-c0d17.png)
  + Formal charges: located on "appropriate atoms"
  + Audio 0:10:37.025317
  + Per atom, to calculate formal charge, you take the valence electrons minus the electrons on it minus the number of pairs on it.

## Practice Problem Assigning Formal Charges

## Rules of Resonance Structures

+ Audio 0:19:11.165662
+ Resonance structures must have the same connectivity.
  + Only electron positions can change.
+ Resonance structures must have the same number of electrons.
+ Second row elements have a maximum of eight electrons.
  + Bonding and nonbonding
  + Third row can have expanded octet
+ Formal charges must total the same.
  + Better structures have fewer formal charges.
  + Better structures have smaller formal charges.
  + Better structures have the negative formal charge on the more electronegative atom.

## Expanded Octets, Odd-Electron, and Other Species: The Exceptions to the Octet “Rule”

+ Audio 0:21:06.805441
+ The exceptions:
+ Expanded octets:
  + Molecules or ions with more than eight electrons around an atom
  + Involve the nonmetal elements located in the 3rd period
and below
+ Nonmetals (3rd period down in the periodic table) follow the
octet rule when they are not the “center” atom.
  + The center atom is the atom in the molecule where the
  other elements individually bond to (attach).
  + When they are the center atom, they can accommodate more than eight electrons.
+ Using empty valence d orbitals that are predicted by
quantum theory
+ Odd-electron species (free radicals or radicals):
+ Molecules or ions with an odd number of electrons
  + Legitimate Lewis structures cannot be written for they do not meet the “octet rule” as required by the Lewis model.
  + Example: NO
    + Has 11 valence electrons
    + Distribution of 11 electrons cannot meet the criteria under the Lewis model.
    + NO does exist as a molecule.
      + The Lewis model is not sophisticated enough to work for an odd number of electron compounds.
+ Audio 0:22:20.060270
+ Incomplete octets:
  + Elements (specifically metalloids and H atom) whose tendency is not to have a complete octet
    + H can only accompany two electrons (duet).
    + Boron (metalloid)
      + Prefer 6 electrons than 8 electrons

## Clicker 2

+ What is the formal charge on the sulfur for best structure for the sulfate anion, SO4^2-?
  + Audio 0:27:21.796062
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-30-week-7-day-3-ef25e.png)
  + Most people said plus 2, but the answer is actually 0

## Bond Energies

+ Audio 0:32:36.686918
+ Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in
reactant molecules and making new bonds to
create the products.
+ The change in energy for a reaction can be
estimated by comparing the cost of breaking old
bonds to the energy released from making new
bonds.
+ The amount of energy, in the gaseous state, that it
takes to break one mole of a bond in a compound is called the bond energy.
+ Audio 0:34:03.982413
+ The energy change required to break a particular bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is the bond energy

## Trends in Bond Energies

+ Audio 0:36:20.771621
+ In general, the more electrons two atoms share, the
stronger the covalent bond.
  + For comparison of bonds between like atoms
  + C≡C (837 kJ) > C═C (611 kJ) > C—C (347 kJ)
  + C≡N (891 kJ) > C ═ N (615 kJ) > C—N (305 kJ)
+ In general, the shorter the covalent bond, the stronger
the bond.
  + For comparison of bonds between like atoms
  + Br—F (237 kJ) > Br—Cl (218 kJ) > Br—Br (193 kJ)
  + Bonds get weaker down the column.
  + Bonds get stronger across the period.

## Average Bond Energies

## Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality for Bond Strength

+ Audio 0:39:20.498710
+ Lewis theory predicts that the more electrons two atoms
share, the stronger the bond.
  + Single bond < Double bond < Triple bond
  + Lewis theory would predict that double bonds are twice as strong as single bonds, but the reality is they are less than twice as strong.
+ *Bond strength* is measured by how much energy must be
added into the bond to break it in half.

## Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality for Bond Length

+ Audio 0:40:57.263317
+ Lewis theory predicts that the more electrons two atoms share, the shorter the bond should be.
  + When comparing bonds to like atoms
+ Bond length is determined by measuring the distance between the nuclei of bonded atoms.
+ In general, triple bonds are shorter than double bonds, and double bonds are shorter than single bonds.

## Bond Lengths

+ Audio 0:42:20.387950
+ The distance between the nuclei of bonded atoms is
called the bond length.
+ Because the actual bond length depends on the other
atoms around the bond, we often use the average
bond length.
  + Averaged for similar bonds from many compounds
