  + n = 4, l=3, m_l = 4, m_s = +1/2
  + A
  + It's an illegal configuration

## Orbital Diagrams

+ Audio 0:02:47.403928
+ we often represent an orbital as a square and the electrons in that orbital as arrows
  + the direction of the arrow represents the spin of the electron

## Electron Configuration for Multi-electron Atoms

+ Audio 0:03:39.319084
+ Aufbau Principle
  + Energy levels and sublevels fill from lowest energy to highest
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-14-week-5-day-2-c8363.png)
+ Orbitals that are in the same sublevel have the same energy
+ There can be no more than two electrons per orbital

## Summarizing the Filling of Electrons in

+ Audio 0:10:29.597607
+ Atomic Orbitals
+ Electrons occupy orbitals so as to minimize the energy of the atom; therefore, lower energy orbitals fill before higher energy orbitals.
  + Orbitals fill in the following order:
    +  1s2s2p3s3p4s3d4p5s4d5p6s.
+ Orbitals can hold no more than two electrons each. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, their spins are opposite.
  + This is another way of expressing the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in one atom can have the same four quantum numbers).

## Order of Subshell Filling in Ground State Electron Configurations

+ Audio 0:12:05.347386
+ start by drawing a diagram putting each energy shell on
a row and listing the subshells, (s, p, d, f), for that shell in order of energy, (left-to-right)
+ next, draw arrows through the diagonals, looping back to the next diagonal each time

## Order of orbitals (filling) in multi-electron atom

+ Audio 0:13:08.640348
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-14-week-5-day-2-dc6b3.png)
+ 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s
  + Smallest n+l. For equal n+l, largest l

## Electron configuration Short Cut

+ Audio 0:14:32.615145
+ Ge: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p2
+ easier: [Ar] 4s2 3d10 4p2
+ i.e. write [last noble gas] remainder of orbitals,

## Example – Write the Ground State Electron Configuration and Orbital Diagram and of Magnesium.

+ Audio 0:16:50.900804
+ How many electrons in Magnesium?
  + 12
+ so need boxes for n=1, n=2 and n=3

## Clicker 2

+ Audio 0:22:03.927929
+ Give the ground state electron configuration for Sr (Z=38)
  + Audio 0:22:55.093958
  + Look at periodic table. Rightmost element before Sr.
    + Find Kr
    + It is the second element past Kr, so it is Kr 5s2

## Finding Patterns: The Periodic Law and the Periodic Table

+ Audio 0:26:15.808183
+ In 1869, Mendeleev noticed that certain groups of elements had similar properties.
+ He found that when elements were listed in order of increasing mass, these similar properties recurred in a periodic pattern.
+ To be periodic means to exhibit a repeating pattern.

## The Periodic Law

+ Audio 0:26:52.707876
+ Mendeleev summarized these observations in the *periodic law*:
  + When the elements are arranged in order of increasing mass, certain sets of properties recur periodically.
+ Note: Mendeleev ignored some of data, e.g. atomic mass of Te > atomic mass of l

## Mendeleev’s Periodic Table

+ Audio 0:28:14.871013
+ Mendeleev’s periodic table
  + organized known elements of the time in a table format.
    + He arranged the rows so that elements with similar properties would fall in the same vertical columns.
  + contained some gaps, which allowed him to predict the existence (and even the properties) of yet undiscovered elements.
    + Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element he called eka-silicon.

## The Modern Periodic Table: Its Format

+ Audio 0:29:46.955888
+ The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number rather than increasing relative mass as they were in Mendeleev’s periodic table.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-14-week-5-day-2-2b7cd.png)
+ Rows of the table are referred to as periods (or just plain rows).
+ Columns in the table are referred to as groups or a family.
  + Elements in a group or family have similar properties.
  + NOTE: Mendeleev’s periodic law predicts pattern but does NOT explain why the patterns or similarity in properties occurs.
    + Quantum theory explains the why

## Core Electrons, Valence Electrons, and the Periodic Table

+ Audio 0:32:14.303407
+ The group number corresponds to the number of electrons in last (unfilled valence shell)
  + valence electrons
+ The length of each “block” is the maximum number of
electrons the sublevel can hold.
+ The period number corresponds to the principal energy level of the valence electrons.

## Orbital blocks and their position in the periodic table

## Transition and Inner Transition Metals

+ Audio 0:34:11.820224
+ Transition metals (d block) and inner transition metals (f block) exhibit trends differing from those of main-group elements (s block and p block).
  + Because of sublevel splitting, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel; therefore, the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital.
  + The difference in energy is not large.
+ Some of the transition metals have irregular electron configurations in which the ns only partially fills before the (n − 1)d or doesn’t fill at all.
  + Therefore, their electron configuration must be found experimentally.

## Examples of Transition and Inner Transition Metals’ Electron Configurations

+ Audio 0:36:43.269485
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-14-week-5-day-2-9ee7f.png)
+ Remember chromium and copper

## Clicker 3

+ Give the ground state electron configuration for Br-
  + [Ar]4s2 3d10 4p6
  + has one more electron than normal because the sign is negative so 4p6


## Electron Configuration and Elemental Properties

+ Audio 0:42:21.308974
+ The properties of the elements follow a periodic pattern.
  + Elements in the same column have similar properties.
  + The elements in a period show a pattern that repeats.
+ The quantum-mechanical model explains this because the number of valence electrons and the types of orbitals they occupy are also periodic.
