+ Scores got changed up, but now they're changed back to what they were originally
+ Ch 4 homework due next week

## Electron Configuration and Elemental Properties: The Metals

+ Audio 0:03:02.434400
+ Metallic elements make up the majority of the elements in the periodic table.
  + Alkali Metals:
    + They have one more electron than the previous noble gas and occupy the first column.
    + In their reactions, the alkali metals lose one electron, and the resulting electron configuration is the same as that of a noble gas.
      + Forming a cation with a 1+ charge
  + Alkaline Earth Metals:
    + They have two more electrons than the previous noble gas and occupy the second column.
+ In their reactions, the alkaline earth metals lose two electrons, and the resulting electron configuration is the same as that of a noble gas.
  + Forming a cation with a 2+ charge

## Clicker 1

+ Audio 0:06:10.831608
+ Give the number of core electrons for Cd
  + Cd atomic # is 48, but based on it's position on the periodic table, the d, valence electrons are not core, so the answer is 46

## Gaining or Losing Electrons

+ Audio 0:09:07.638465
+ Electrons want to be in the lowest lying orbital that has a vacancy
+ If that is on another atom: electron transfers and get an ion
+ Orbitals shrink across periodic table as nuclear charge increases across periodic table
+ For metals: energy of orbitals is (generally) higher than surrounding matter: lose electrons and make cations
+ For non-metals: energy of orbital is (generally) lower than surrounding matter: gain electrons and make anions

## Orbital Blocks and Their Position in the Periodic Table

## Electron Configuration and Elemental Properties: Noble Gases

+ Audio 0:14:56.898668
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-115ec.png)
+ The noble gases have eight valence electrons.
  + Except for He, which has only two electrons
+ They are especially nonreactive.
  + He and Ne are practically inert.
+ The reason the noble gases are so nonreactive is that the electron configuration of the noble gases is especially stable.

## Electron Configuration and Ion Formation

+ Audio 0:15:50.407566
+ Ion formation can be predicted by an element’s location in the periodic table.
+ These atoms form ions that will result in an electron configuration that is the same as that of the nearest noble gas.
+ Metals form cations (positively charged atoms).
  + Alkali metals (group 1A) form only +1 cations.
  + Alkaline earth metals (group 2A) form only +2 cations.
  + Transition, inner transition, and p-block metals form a variety of charged cations.
+ Nonmetals form anions (negatively charged atoms).
+ Halogens (group 7A) usually gain one electron to form –1 anions.
  + Other nonmetals can form a variety of charged anions.

## Effective Nuclear Charge and the Screening Effect

+ Audio 0:17:40.420403
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-b703a.png)
  + Nuclear charge minus core electrons

## Effective Nuclear Charge

+ Audio 0:18:34.927551
+ The effective nuclear charge is a net positive charge that is attracting a particular electron.
+ Core electrons efficiently shield electrons in the outermost principal energy level from nuclear charge.
+ Outermost electrons in the valence shell do not efficiently shield one another from nuclear charge.
+ Z is the nuclear charge, and S is the number of electrons in lower energy levels.
  + Electrons in the same energy level contribute to screening, but since their contribution is so small, they are not part of the calculation.

## Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge

+ Audio 0:20:20.485159
+  There are several methods for measuring the radius of an atom,and they give slightly different numbers.
  + Van der Waals radius = nonbonding
  + Covalent radius = bonding radius
  + Atomic radius is an average radius of an atom based on measuring large numbers of compounds.

## Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge

+ Audio 0:21:45.986365

  + Effective nuclear charge increases.
  + Valence shell held closer
+ Atomic radius increases down a group.
  + Valence shell farther from nucleus
  + Effective nuclear charge fairly constant (expansion
mostly due to increasing n)

## Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements

+ Audio 0:25:24.843667
+ The size of an atom is related to the distance the valence electrons are from the nucleus.
  + The larger the orbital an electron is in, the farther its most probable distance will be from the nucleus, and the less attraction it will have for the nucleus.
  + Traversing down a group adds a principal energy level, and the larger the principal energy level an orbital is in, the larger its volume.
  + Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get larger down a column.

## Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements

+ Audio 0:26:14.499563
+ The larger the effective nuclear charge an electron experiences, the stronger the attraction it will have for the nucleus.
  + The closer their average distance will be to the nucleus, the stronger the attraction the valence electrons have for the nucleus.
  + Traversing across a period increases the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons.
  + Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get smaller across a period.

## Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Transition Elements

+ Audio 0:26:56.496332
+ Atoms in the same group increase in size down the column.
+ Atomic radii of transition metals are roughly the same size across the d block.
  + Much less difference than across main group elements
  + Valence shell ns2, not the (n − 1)d electrons
  + Effective nuclear charge on the ns2 electrons approximately the same

## Ions: Magnetic Properties

+ Audio 0:27:41.873967
+ Electron configurations that result in unpaired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have a net magnetic field; this is called
paramagnetism.
  + Will be attracted to a magnetic field
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-f8333.png)
+ Electron configurations that result in all paired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have no magnetic field; this is called
diamagnetism.
  + Slightly repelled by a magnetic field
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-af5dc.png)

## Radii of Atoms and Their Ions: Cations

+ Audio 0:30:05.119746
+ Cation radius is smaller than its corresponding atom radius.
  + Loose electrons experiencing small effective nuclear charge; remaining electrons those experiencing a larger effective nuclear charge
+ Traversing down a group increases the (n − 1) level, causing the cations to get larger.
+ Traversing to the right across a period increases the effective nuclear charge for *isoelectronic* cations, causing the cations to get smaller.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-dda34.png)
+ Audio 0:32:15.588321
+ isoelectronic = same number of electrons

## Radii of Atoms and Their Ions: Anions

+ Audio 0:32:32.478937
+ When atoms form anions, electrons are added to the valence shell.
+ Addition of electrons increases repulsion in valence shell without compensating increase in effective nuclear charge
+ The result is that the anion is larger than the atom. Traversing down a group increases the n level, causing the anions to get larger.
+ Traversing to the left across a period decreases the effective nuclear charge for isoelectronic anions, causing the anions to get *larger*.

  +  Br-, Na+, Rb+
    + Na+, Rb+, Br-

## Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)

+ Audio 0:37:37.889283
+ Ionization Energy (IE):
+ It is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or ion in the gas phase.
+ It is an endothermic process (requires the input of energy to remove the electron)
  + Valence electron easiest to remove, lowest IE
+ First ionization energy = energy to remove electron from neutral atom –  All atoms have first ionization energy.
M(g) + IE1 èM1+(g) + 1 e–
+ Second IE = energy to remove from 1+ ion, etc. M+1(g)
+ IE2 è M2+(g) + 1 e–
+ Audio 0:39:07.357544
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-6c154.png)
  + increases as you go across the periodic table
  + Charge shrinks the nucleus, takes more energy to remove the charge

## Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)

+ Audio 0:40:38.726742
Ionization Energy (IE):
+ The larger the effective nuclear charge on the electron to be removed,
the more energy it takes to remove it.
+ The farther the most probable distance the electron is from the nucleus, the less energy it takes to remove it.
+ Trend:
  + First IE decreases down the group.
+ Valence electron is farther from nucleus.
  + First IE generally increases across the period. + Effective nuclear charge increases.

## Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)

+ Audio 0:40:54.665440
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-1e357.png)

+ Audio 0:42:14.239301
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-6c154.png)
  + Nitrogen has three unpaired electrons, the next electron has to go down an orbital which will make it a little easier to remove the last electron in oxygen to get to nitrogen.

## First Ionization Energy: Exceptions to the Trend

+ Audio 0:43:42.531942
+ GENERAL trend for first ionization energy of main-group elements is that as you go across a period, ionization energy increases.
  + Exceptions: 2A to 3A and 5A to 6A
+ Exceptions are usually a result of
  + the type of orbital (s, p, d, or f) and its shielding ability;
  + repulsion factors associated with electrons occupying degenerate orbitals (i.e., p orbitals).
+ B has smaller first ionization energy than Be due to electron position: 2p for B and 2s for Be.
The electron in 2p orbitals has more shielding (i.e., lower effective nuclear charge) and therefore requires less energy for its removal than an electron in a 2s orbital.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-16-week-5-day-3-edc55.png)

## Trends of Second and Successive Ionization Energies

+ Audio 0:44:46.840846
+ They depend on the number of valence electrons an element has.
–  ionization energies increase dramatically in going from valence to core electrons
+ Removal of each successive electron costs more energy.
–  Shrinkage in size due to having more protons than electrons
–  Outer electrons closer to the nucleus; therefore harder to remove
+ There’s a regular increase in energy for each successive valence electron.
