## Properties of Waves

+ Audio 0:19:09.721677
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-08-31-week-3-day-2-ee942.png)
+ Wavelength (λ) is the distance between identical points on successive waves.
+ Amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline of a wave to the peak or trough.
+ Audio 0:20:20.914304
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-08-31-week-3-day-2-d3c55.png)
+ Frequency (ν) is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in 1 second (Hz = 1 cycle/s).
+ Audio 0:21:32.710413
+ The speed (v) of the wave = λ x ν

## Light

+ Audio 0:23:42.023732

## Amplitude and Wavelength

+ Audio 0:24:52.722734
+ Wavelength and amplitude are independent properties.
  + The wavelength of light determines its color (intensive physical property).
+ The amplitude, or intensity, determines its brightness (extensive physical property)
  + Brightness dependent on amplitude

## Color

+ Audio 0:26:15.944132
+ The color of light is determined by its wavelength or frequency.
+ White light is a mixture of all the colors of visible light.
  + A spectrum
  + Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet
+ When an object absorbs some of the wavelengths of white light and reflects others, it appears colored; the observed color is predominantly the colors reflected.

## Maxwell

+ Audio 0:26:23.185612
+ Maxwell (1873), proposed that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves.

## Example problem

+ Audio 0:30:56.499318
+ An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 6.0 x 10^4 Hz. Does this frequency fall in the visible region? Convert this frequency into wavelength (nm).

## Clicker Question

+ Audio 0:34:13.178546
+ What is the wave length of a wave with frequency 8.6 * 10^13 Hz?

## Einstein and the Photoelectronic Effect

+ Audio 0:39:00.844561
+ Hertz observed that when (some) light shines on a metal surface, electrons are produced from the surface.
  + The electrons emitted from the metal surface are photoelectrons.
  + This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-08-31-week-3-day-2-d3c74.png)
+ Audio 0:40:20.734175
1. Number of electrons depends upon light intensity
2. More Kinetic energy at higher frequency of light
3. Emission has a frequency threshold, below which there are no electrons

## Explaining the Photoelectric Effect

+ Audio 0:42:05.218727
+ Classic theory explanation:
  + The photoelectric effect according to classic wave theory attributed the electrons’ being emitted from the metal surface to the light energy being transferred to the electrons.
  + Classic theory states the following:
    + If the wavelength of light is made shorter or the light wave’s
    intensity is made brighter, more electrons should be ejected.
    + Energy of a wave is directly proportional to its amplitude and its frequency.
      + Example: If a dim light is used there should be a lag time before electrons are emitted in order to give the electrons time to absorb enough energy.

## Explaining the Photoelectric Effect

+ Audio 0:42:13.093629
+ Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory
  + Experimental observations indicate the following:
    + A minimum frequency was needed before electrons would be emitted regardless of the intensity called the threshold frequency.
    + High-frequency light from a dim source caused electron emission without any lag time.

## Einstein’s idea: “Light Is Quantized.”

+ Audio 0:43:33.274758
+ Ejection of electrons from a metal surface by light:
  + One photon at the threshold frequency gives the electron just enough energy for it to escape the atom.
  + Binding energy, φ
  + When irradiated with a shorter wavelength photon, the electron absorbs more energy than is necessary to escape.
  + This excess energy becomes kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

  + Where (hυ) is a quantized packet of energy

## Explaining the Photoelectric Effect

+ Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory
  + Einstein proposed that the light energy was delivered to the atoms in packets called quanta or photons.
    + Energy = (hυ)
      + hυ = quanta
  + The energy of a photon of light is directly proportional to its frequency.
    + E = hc/λ
    + Or it is inversely proportional to its wavelength.
  + Symbols:
    + Planck’s Constant, (h) is a proportionality constant with a value of h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s.
    + Speed of light (c) value is 3.00 × 108 m/s

## Black Body Radiation

+ Audio 0:46:37.258672
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-08-31-week-3-day-2-f06fe.png)
+ If you heat something up in the dark, you can see it with infrared radiation
+ “Black Body Problem” Solved by Planck in 1900
"... an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics ..."
Energy (light) is emitted or absorbed in discrete units (quantum).
