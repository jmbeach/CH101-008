+ Test 3 is Wednesday at 6:30 pm in our usual location!   
  + Bring a photo ID, a calculator and a pencil (a periodic table will be provided for you).
+ Test 3 is on *chapter 7 through the beginning of chapter 10*.
  + I recommend going to the [MyLabsPlus](https://secure.ecollege.com/alabama/index.learn?action=welcome) website and doing the "End of Chapter Problems" for these chapters.
+ The easiest way to study for this test is to go back through the clicker questions and practice problems from the notes on these sections and to try to work the recitation questions. Most of the practice problems have videos which are nice for learning how to work them.
