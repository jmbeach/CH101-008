## Applying Wave Theory

## Why is e- energy quantized?

+ Audio 0:01:44.988052
+ De Broglie (1924) reasoned that e- is both particle and
wave.
  + Electron is a particle but has wave properties
  + Particles therefore must have both wave and particle properties

## Schrodinger Wave Equation

+ Audio 0:04:54.889022
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-09-week-4-day-2-bb7de.png)
    + Don't have to know this
    + H is an operator
    + Audio 0:06:08.804355
+ In 1926 Schrodinger wrote an equation that described both the particle and wave nature of the e
+ H is called an "operator": in this case taking the second derivative with respect to x, y, and z. E is the energy
+ Solution is a wave function: Ψ
+ Audio 0:06:34.389254
1. energy of e- is given by Ψ
2. Ψ2 is the probability of finding e- in a volume of space
+ A simple example of a wavefunction is:
  + Ψ=Asin(x)
+ energy of e- is given by Ψ
+ Audio 0:08:02.302205
+ *Ψ^2 is the probability* of finding e- in a volume of space
+ Audio 0:09:23.819222
+ Schrodinger’s equation can only be solved exactly for simple systems (H atom). Must approximate its solution for multi- electron systems.
  + Our approximations though are good enough to work in practical application
  + Horizon made it to Pluto for example

## Quantum Numbers: The Solutions from the Wave Function, ψ

+ Audio 0:12:06.144429
+ Calculations show that the size, shape, and orientation in space of an orbital are determined by three integer terms in the wave function.
  + Quantize the energy of the electron
+ These integers (solutions) are called *quantum numbers*.
  + There are four quantum numbers:
    + Principal quantum number,n
      + Energy level
  + Angular momentum quantum number, l
    + Orbital type
+ Magnetic quantum number, ml
  + Audio 0:14:21.378733
  + Position of orbital in an X-Y-Z plot
+ Spin quantum number, ms
  + Orientation of the spin of the electron
+ These quantum numbers control how electrons are distributed in an atom

## Principal Quantum Number, n: The Energy Level

+ Audio 0:15:13.929935
+ It characterizes the energy of the electron in a particular orbital.
  + It is Bohr’s energy level.
+ Values of n can be any whole number integer >= 1.
+  It *determines the size (overall) and energy of an orbital*.
  + The larger the value of n, the more energy the orbital has.
  + The larger the value of n, the larger the orbital.
+ Audio 0:17:10.934989
+ Energies are defined as being “negative.”
  + An electron’s energy is lowered (made more negative) as a result of its interaction with the nucleus of the atom.
    + An electron would have E = 0 when it escapes the atom.
  + As n gets larger, the following occurs:
    + The amount of energy between orbitals gets smaller.
    + The energy of the orbital becomes greater (less negative).

  + Won't have to memorize this, but will need to know the energy is about 1/n^2
+ Rydberg constant for hydrogen (R_h) is 2.10 * 10^-8 J

## Principal Energy Level in

## Angular Momentum Quantum Number, l: The Orbital Quantum Number

+ Audio 0:19:37.169700
+ The angular momentum quantum number *determines the shape of the orbital*.
  + l can have integer values from 0 to (n – 1).
    + Ex n = 1
      + Only l=0 is allowed
    + n = 2
      + l = 0 or l = 1 are allowed
+ Each value of l is designated by a particular letter that
designates the shape of the orbital.
  + s orbitals are spherical.
  + p orbitals are like two balloons tied at the knots (dumbbell shape).
  + d orbitals are mainly like four balloons tied at the knots.
  + f orbitals are mainly like eight balloons tied at the knots.

## Magnetic Quantum Number, ml: The Position or Orientation Quantum Number

+ Audio 0:22:55.744076
+ The magnetic quantum number is an integer that specifies the orientation of the orbital.
  + The direction in space the orbital is aligned relative to the other orbitals
+ Values are integers from −l to +l.
  + Including zero
  + Gives the number of orbitals of a particular shape
    + When l=2,the values of ml are−2,−1,0,+1,+2, which means there are five orbitals with l = 2.

## Describing an Orbital

+ Audio 0:24:11.173521
+ Each set of n, l, and ml describes one orbital.
+ Orbitals with the same value of n are in the
same principal energy level.
  + Also called the principal shell
+ Orbitals with the same values of n and l are said to be in the same sublevel.
  + Also called a subshell

## Illustration of Energy Levels and Sublevels

## Energy Levels and Sublevels

+ Audio 0:26:50.216152
+ In general:
  + The number of sublevels within a level = n
  + the number of orbitals within a level = 2l + 1
  + The number of orbitals in a level = n^2

## Quantum Leaps

+ Audio 0:27:59.907574
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-09-week-4-day-2-19bd6.png)
  + When  an electron falls from a higher to lower energy level, light is emitted
    + An unstable state is when an electron is sitting in a state greater than 1

## How Does the Quantum Mechanical Model of an Atom Explain Atomic Spectra?

+ Audio 0:29:26.973235
+ Each wavelength in the spectrum of an atom corresponds to an electron transition between
orbitals.
+ When an electron is excited, it transitions from an orbital in a lower energy level to an orbital in a higher energy level.
+ When an electron relaxes, it transitions from an orbital in a higher energy level to an orbital in a lower energy level.
+ When an electron relaxes, a photon of light is released whose energy equals the energy difference between the orbitals.

## It Explains Electron Transitions

+ Audio 0:30:54.218927
+ To transition to a higher energy state, the electron must gain the correct amount of energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.
+ Electrons in high energy states are unstable and tend to lose energy and transition to lower energy states.
+ Each line in the emission spectrum corresponds to the difference in energy between two energy states.

## It Predicts the Spectrum of Hydrogen

+ Audio 0:31:35.930644
• For an electron in an energy state n, there are (n–1) energy states it can transition to. Therefore, it can generate (n – 1) lines.

## Energy Transitions in Hydrogen

+ Audio 0:32:20.175336
+ The energy of a photon released is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels the electron is jumping between.
+ It can be calculated by subtracting the energy of the initial state from the energy of the final state.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-09-week-4-day-2-e86c3.png)
  + Don't have to memorize this, just remember the 1/n^2 part

+ Calculate the wavelength of the light emitted by a
hydrogen atom during a transition of its electron from the n = 4 to the n = 1 principal energy level. Recall that for hydrogen En = -2.18 * 10-18 J*(1/n2)

+ Audio 0:45:56.374508

hydrogen using the Bohr equation. Calculate the ionization
energy for an atom of hydrogen, making the assumption
that ionization is the transition from n=1 to n=infinity
