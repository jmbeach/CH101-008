+ According to VSEPR theory, which one of the following molecules should have a molecular geometry that is trigonal bipyramidal?
  + SF4
  + XeF4
  + NF3
  + SF6
  + PF5
+ The answer is PF5 because it is the only answer with five atoms attached to the central atom

## Representing Three-Dimensional Shapes on Paper

+ Audio 0:07:41.096639
+ Drawing molecules to show their dimensionality on paper (2-D) is difficult.
+ How to draw a 3-D representation of molecule on paper:
  + By convention, the central atom is put in the plane of the paper.
  + Put as many other atoms as possible in the same plane and indicate with a *straight line*.
  + For atoms in front of the plane, use a *solid wedge*.
  + For atoms behind the plane, use a *hashed wedge*

## Multiple Central Atoms and Their Geometries

+ Audio 0:11:15.077734
+ Many molecules have larger structures with many interior atoms.
  + Looking at "multiple center atoms"
  + Think of them as having multiple central atoms.
+ For multiple center molecules:
  + Each center atom has a designated a shape.
+ Example: Glycine
+ The shape around the:
  + N atom is trigonal pyramidal
  + Left C is tetrahedral
  + Right C is trigonal planar
  + O is bent
