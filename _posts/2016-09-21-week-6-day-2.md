+ Homework issue
  + Electron configurations
    + There are differences sometimes in the order of writing them.
    + You get five or six freebies
      + If you've checked the electron configuration and it says you're wrong, it may be the way the website works.
+ Audio 0:02:01.735946
+ Real world is complicated
  + He isn't going to tell us anything that is *wrong* but everything we're learning is a really watered-down, simplified version of the truth


## Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation: Using NaCl as an Example

+ Audio 0:05:03.029702
  + Where we left off
The ionization energy of the metal is endothermic.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-19-week-6-day-1-ada36.png)
+ The electron affinity of the nonmetal is exothermic.
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-19-week-6-day-1-1841b.png)
+ Generally, the ionization energy of the metal is larger than the electron affinity of the nonmetal; therefore, the formation of the ionic compound should be endothermic.
+ But the heat of formation of most ionic compounds is exothermic and generally large.

## Crystal Lattice and Lattice Energy of NaCl

+ Audio 0:05:58.951668
  + Part of the energy formula in the previous slide does not add up because it does not account for the lattice shape of the compound
+ Lattice energy
  + The extra stability that accompanies the formation of the crystal lattice is measured as the *lattice energy*.
    + Audio 0:07:54.475155
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-21-week-6-day-2-21f4e.png)
  + It is the energy released when the solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.
    + Always exothermic
  +  Lattice energy is measured directly but is calculated from knowledge of other processes.
  +  It depends directly on the size of charges and inversely on distance between ions.
    + (Coulomb's law)
    + Audio 0:09:53.359903
    + The most stable lattice is a very difficult calculation

## Ionic Bonding Model versus Reality

+ Audio 0:10:12.809739
+ implies that the positions of the ions in the crystal lattice are critical to the stability of the structure.
+ predicts that moving ions out of position should therefore be difficult, and ionic solids should be hard.
  + Ionic solids are relatively hard compared to most molecular solids.
    + If you've ever touched a crystal, this is obvious
+ implies that if the ions are displaced from their position in the crystal lattice, repulsive forces should occur.
  + this predicts that the crystal will become unstable and break apart. Theory predicts that ionic solids will be brittle.
    + If you strike a crystal with a hammer, it will shatter because it becomes unstable
      + The same is not true for metals
    + Ionic solids are brittle. When struck, they shatter.
+ Audio 0:13:21.487007
+ implies that, in the ionic solid, the ions are locked in position and cannot move around.
+ predicts that ionic solids should not conduct electricity.
  + Audio 0:12:23.638218
  + To conduct electricity, a material must have charged particles that are able to flow through the material.
  + *Ionic solids do not conduct electricity*.
+ implies that, in the liquid state or when dissolved in water, the ions will have the ability to move around.
predicts that both a liquid ionic compound and an ionic compound dissolved in water should conduct electricity.
  + Ionic compounds conduct electricity in the liquid state or when dissolved in water.

## Conductivity of NaCl

+ Audio 0:14:19.003024
+ In NaCl(s), the ions are stuck in position and not able to move to the charged rods.

## Ionic Bonding and the Crystal Lattice

+ Audio 0:14:34.266075
+ The extra energy that is released comes from the formation of a structure in which every cation is surrounded by anions and vice versa.
  + This structure is called a *crystal lattice*.
+ The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.
  + Electrostatic attraction is a nondirectional force.
    + Therefore, there is *no ionic molecule*.
      + The chemical formula is an empirical formula, simply giving the ratio of ions based on charge balance.
+ The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between cations and anions leading to the most stable arrangement

## Ionic Compounds

+ Audio 0:16:15.553827
+ Ionic compounds are composed of cations (metals) and anions (nonmetals) bound together by ionic bonds.
  + Examples of ionic compounds:
    + NaBr, Al2(CO3)3, CaHPO4, and MgSO4
+ The basic unit of an ionic compound is the formula unit, the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions.
  + Example:
    + The ionic compound table salt, with the *formula unit* NaCl, is composed of Na+ and Cl+ions in a one-to-one ratio.
+ Summarizing Ionic Compound Formulas
  + Ionic compounds always contain positive and negative ions.
  + In a chemical formula, the sum of the charges of the positive ions (cations) must equal the sum of the charges of the negative ions (anions).
  + The formula of an ionic compound reflects the smallest whole-number ratio of ions.

## Nomenclature: Naming Compounds+ Audio 0:18:01.496531+ Organic compounds: predominantly carbon Usually plus H, O, N, S+ Inorganic compounds: everything else+ Ionic Compounds: Cation followed by anion +-ide
## Naming Ionic Compounds+ Audio 0:19:25.857435+ Ionic compounds can be categorized into two types, depending on the metal in the compound.+ The first type contains a metal whose charge is invariant from one compound to another.+ Whenever the metal in this first type of compound forms an ion, the ion always has the same charge.

## Naming Binary Ionic Compounds of Type I Cations

+ Audio 0:22:33.873986
+ Binary compounds contain only two different elements. The names of binary ionic compounds take the following form:
+ For example, the name for KCl consists of the name of the cation, potassium, followed by the base name of the anion, chlor, with the ending -ide.
  + KCl is potassium chloride.
    + We know potasium is +1, we know Cl is -1, so we don't have to write it
+ The name for CaO consists of the name of the cation, calcium,
followed by the base name of the anion, ox, with the ending -ide.
  + CaO is calcium oxide.

## Chemical Nomenclature

+ Audio 0:23:49.504979
+ Ionic Compounds
  + often a metal + nonmetal
  + anion (nonmetal), add “ide” to element name

## Clicker 1

+ Write the formula for calcium nitride
  + Ca_3N_2

## Lewis Structure Model: Representing a Substance’s Valence Electrons

+ Audio 0:26:31.209408
+ The Lewis Model:
  + Valence electrons are represented as dots.
    + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-21-week-6-day-2-b7090.png)
+ Lewis electron-dot structures (Lewis structures) depict the structural formula with its valence electrons.
+ Audio 0:27:52.445649
+ Lewis structures focus on valence electrons because chemical bonding involves the transfer or sharing of valence electrons between two or more atoms.

## Octet Rule: A Guideline for Molecule Formation

+ Audio 0:28:08.406107
+ When atoms bond, they tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to give a noble gas–like configuration.
  + ns2np6
+ Nonmetals: period 2 elements must obey the octet rule (i.e., eight valence electrons around each atom in the molecule).
+ Exceptions to the octet rule: Expanded octets
  + (Sometimes octet rule doesn't work)
  + Audio 0:29:09.248458
  + They involve the nonmetal elements located in period 3 and below.
  + Nonmetals (period 3 on down in the periodic table) follow the octet rule when they are not the center atom.
    + The center atom is the atom in the molecule that the other elements individually bond (attach) to.
  + When they are the center atom, they can accommodate more than eight electrons.
+ Using empty valence d orbitals that are predicted by quantum theory

## Multivalent Metals: Naming Type II Ionic Compounds

+ Audio 0:30:05.304852
+ The metals in this category tend to have multiple charges (i.e., multivalent cations):
+ Their charge cannot be predicted as in the case of most representative elements and must be noted in their name.
+ Transition and inner transition metals
  + Iron (Fe) forms a 2+ cation in some of its compounds and a 3+ cation in others.
    + FeSO4: Here iron is a +2 cation (Fe2+).
    + Fe2(SO4)3: Here iron is a +3 cation (Fe3+).
+ Many of the p-block metals
  + Not all p-block metals are multivalent.
  + Some main-group metals, such as Pb, Tl, and Sn, form more than one type of cation.

## Type II Cation

+ Audio 0:31:26.941062

## Naming Type II Binary Ionic Compounds— Example: CrBr3

+ Audio 0:32:36.900613
+ To name CrBr_3, cation + total anion charge = 0
  + Cr charge + 3(Br+charge) = 0
  + Since each Br has a –1 charge, then
    + Cr charge + 3(–1) = 0
    + Cr charge + (–3) = 0
    + Cr = +3
  + Hence, the cation Cr3+ is called chromium(III), and Br^- is called bromide.
+ The name for CrBr3 is chromium(III) bromide.

# Polyatomic Ions

+ Audio 0:33:44.947274

## Oxyanions

+ Audio 0:34:09.654184
+ Most polyatomic ions are *oxyanions*, anions containing oxygen and another element.
+ Noticethatwhenaseriesofoxyanionscontainsdifferent numbers of oxygen atoms, the oxyanions are named according to the number of oxygen atoms in the ion.
+ Iftherearetwoionsintheseries,
  + the one with more oxygen atoms has the ending -ate; and
  +the one with fewer has the ending -ite.
+ Forexample,
  + NO3+is nitrate SO_4^2+ is sulfate
  + NO2+is nitrite SO_3^2+ is sulfite
+ If there are more than two ions in the series, then the prefixes hypo-, meaning less than, and per-,
meaning more than, are used.

## Naming Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions

+ Audio 0:36:49.401712
+ Ionic compounds that contain a polyatomic ion rather than a simple anion (e.g., Cl–) are named in the same manner as binary ionic compounds, except that the name of the polyatomic ion used.
  + For example, NaNO2 is named according to
    + its cation, Na+, sodium; and
    + its polyatomic anion, NO2–, nitrite.
  +  Hence, NaNO2 is sodium nitrite.

## Common Polyatomic Ions

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-21-week-6-day-2-d5e7f.png)
