## Exchanging Energy between System and Surroundings

+ Exchange of heat energy
  + q = mass × specific heat × ΔTemperature
+ Exchange of work
  + w = −Pressure × ΔVolume

## Measuring ΔE: Calorimetry at Constant Volume

+ Because ΔE = q + w, ΔE can be determined by measuring q and w.
+ In practice, it is easiest to do a process in such a way that there is no change in volume, so w = 0.
  + At constant volume, ΔEsystem = qsystem.
+ In practice, temperature changes of individual chemicals involved in the reaction cannot be observed directly, so instead the temperature change in the surroundings is measured.
  + Using an insulated container (e.g., controlled surroundings)
  + qsystem = −qsurroundings
+ The surrounding area is called a *bomb calorimeter* and is usually made of a sealed, insulated container filled with water.
  + qsurroundings = qcalorimeter = –qsystem

## Bomb Calorimeter

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-14-week-14-day-1-04617.png)
+ It is used to measure ΔE because it is a constant volume system.
+ The heat capacity of the calorimeter is the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter for each degree rise in temperature and is called the *calorimeter constant*.
  + Ccal, kJ/°C

## Practice Problem: Measuring ΔErxn in a Bomb Calorimeter

+ When 1.010 g of sucrose (C12H22O11) undergoes combustion in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature rises from 24.92 oC to 28.33 oC. Find ΔErxn for the combustion of sucrose (in kJ/mol). The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 4.90 kJ/oC.

## Clicker 2

+ A 35.6 g sample of ethanol (C2H5OH) is burned in a bomb calorimeter, according to the following reaction. If the temperature rose from 35.0 to 76.0°C and the heat capacity of the calorimeter is 23.3 kJ/°C, what is the value of ΔErxn? The molar mass of ethanol is 46.07 g/mol.
  + C2H5OH(l) + 3 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(g) ΔErxn = ?
  + A) -1.24 × 103 kJ/mol
  + B) +1.24 × 103 kJ/mol
  + C) -8.09 × 103 kJ/mol
  + D) -9.55 × 103 kJ/mol
  + E) +9.55 × 103 kJ/mol

## Enthalpy: Heat Evolved at Constant Pressure

+ “Bomb” Calorimetry is nice but…. we would like to work at atmospheric pressure
+ For a system at e.g. atmospheric pressure the total energy is E plus the energy required to push the gas aside to make space for the system: PV
+ The *enthalpy, H*, of a system is the sum of the internal energy of the system and the product of pressure and volume.
  + H is a state function.
    + H = E + PV
+ The *enthalpy change, ΔH*, of a reaction is the heat evolved in a reaction at constant pressure.
  + ΔHreaction = qreaction at constant pressure
+ Usually ΔH and ΔE are similar in value; the difference is largest for reactions that produce or use large quantities of gas.

## Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions

+ When ΔH is negative, heat is being released by the system into the surroundings.
  + The surroundings will “feel” hot.
  + Temperature of the surroundings increased from the energy released by the system.
  + This is called an *exothermic reaction*.
+ When ΔH is positive, heat is being absorbed by the system from the surroundings.
  + The surroundings will “feel” cold.
+ Temperature of the surroundings decreased because energy left the surroundings to flow into the system.
+ This is called an *endothermic reaction*.

## Particulate View of Exothermic Reactions

+ For an exothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature rises due to a release of thermal energy by the reaction.
+ This extra thermal energy comes from the conversion of some of the chemical potential energy in the reactants into kinetic energy in the form of heat.
+ During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken and new bonds are made.
+ The products of the reaction have less chemical potential energy than the reactants.
+ The difference in energy is released as heat.

## Particulate View of Endothermic Reactions

+ In an endothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature drops due to absorption of some of its thermal energy by the reaction.
+ During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken and new bonds are made.
+ The products of the reaction have more chemical potential energy than the reactants.
+ To acquire this extra energy, some of the thermal energy of the surroundings is converted into chemical potential energy stored in the products.

## Enthalpy of Chemical Reaction

+ The enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is an extensive property.
  + The more reactants you use, the larger the enthalpy change.
+ By convention, we calculate the enthalpy change for the number of moles of reactants in the reaction as written. C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) → 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ΔH = −2044 kJ 1 mol C3H8(g) = –2044 kJ or 5 mol O2(g) = –2044 kJ

## Practice Problem: Enthalpy Stoichiometry

+ Calculate the heat (in kJ) associated with the complete combustion of all of the propane in a 13.2 kg propane tank: C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) è 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) ΔHrxn= -2044 kJ

## Measuring ΔH: Calorimetry at Constant Pressure

+ Reactions done in aqueous solution are at constant pressure.
+ The calorimeter is often nested foam cups containing the solution.
  + qreaction = –qsolution = –(masssolution × Cs, solution × ΔT)
+ ΔHreaction = qconstant pressure = qreaction
  + To get ΔHreaction per mol, divide by the number of moles.

## Practice Problem: Calorimetry Magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid:

+ Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) --> MgCl2 + H2(g) you combine 0.158 g of Mg with enough HCl to make 100.0 mL of solution in a coffee-cup calorimeter. T of the solution rises from 25.6 oC to 32.8 oC. Find ΔHrxn, assume density of solution is 1.00g/ml
