## How to Pass CH101: the High School Version

+ Pay attention, ask questions, complete your homework

## How to pass the college version

+ Do not take it in the summer
+ Read ahead
  + You'll read more new words than when taking a foreign language
  + There is more material than anyone can memorize: you need to understand
  + Seriously compounding: each new topic builds on previous ones
+ DO NOT GET BEHIND
+ Go back over each days class
  + Reread text book to fix things that were unclear in class
  + It's up to you to learn the material
  + Correct / amplify notes as needed
+ Join a study group
+ Do online homework "as we go"
  + Assigned homework is minimum set
  + *10-12 hours a week out of class*
  + Use the practice problems to test yourself
    + If you can't work the practice problems with the textbook closed, then you won't necessarily do well on the test
  + Attempt the problems you can't immediately see how to work
+ Do much more than the minimum

## My Labs Plus

+ This is where you do your homework and pre-labs
+ DO NOT USE THE CODE FOR THE LAB
  + You'll be given that at your lab time
+ University of Alabama Login URL:  http://ua.mylabsplus.com
  + Students Username : MyBama ID (all lower case)
  + Students Password : CWID
  + Click on your course under the Fall 2016 tab
  + Accept Terms of Agreement
  + Input Access code (purchased from the bookstore), purchase Access Code, or choose Pay Later to receive 14 days of temporary access
  + Your access code is good for 24 months

## Syllabus overview

+ How fast we cover a section depends on how well we perform to some degree
+ Tests are not commutative in the sense that future tests will not ask the same exact questions
  + However knowledge of the previous test might be required to answer questions on future tests
+ Office hours are Mondays 5-6, Thursdays 4-5
  + Don't need an appointment

## Test Format

+ Some questions will be vocabish "word" questions and have "word answers"
+ Some questions ask you if a situation is reasonable

## The textbook

+ The second edition

## Labs do not meet this week

## Attendance

+ Using your clicker at all gets you half a point
+ Using it correctly or luckily gets you the other half

## Tests

+ Need to bring an ID
+ Labs can't be programmable

## There will not be recitation this evening

# Chapter 1 - Atoms

## Matter from the Particulate Point of View

+ Matter is composed of particles
  + Example: subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, and electrons, atoms, and molecules
    + "We divide the universe into two types of stuff"
+ How the particles come together dictates the physical properties of matter
  + How do things transform
+ Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space (e.g., has volume)


## Elements, Molecules, and Mixtures: The Types of Matter

+ *Atoms*
  + Basic submicroscopic particles that constitute the
fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter
+ *Molecules*
  + Substances formed when two or more atoms
come together (bond) in specific geometric
arrangements
+ Atoms and molecules determine how matter behaves
+ *Chemistry* is a discipline that seeks to understand
matter and its properties, and the transformations
that matter undergoes- particularly between
molecules.

## The Classification of Matter

+ Matter can be classified according to
  + its *state* — its physical form (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas) based on what properties it exhibits;
  + its *composition* or the types of particles
+ The state of matter changes from solid to liquid to gas with increasing temperature

## Solid Matter
+ In *solid matter*, atoms or molecules pack
close to each other in fixed locations.
+ Although the atoms and molecules in a solid
vibrate, they do not move around or past
each other.
+ Consequently, a solid has a fixed volume and
rigid shape.
  + Ice, aluminum, and diamond are good examples
of solids.

## Liquid Matter
+ In *liquid matter*, atoms or molecules pack about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each other.
+ Liquids have fixed volume but not a fixed shape.
+ Liquids’ ability to flow makes them assume the shape of their container.
  + Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at room temperature.

## Gaseous Matter
+ In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them.
+ They are free to move relative to one another.
+ Fill available space
+ These qualities make gases *compressible*.

## Classification of Matter by Components
+ Matter can be classified according to its composition: elements, compounds, and mixtures.
+ a *pure substance* is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant
+ a *mixture* is a substance composed of two or more components in proportions that can vary from one sample to another
