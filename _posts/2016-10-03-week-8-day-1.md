  + Means 16 pairs
  + This can be drawn 5 different ways.

# VSEPR Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion a Method of Predicting Geometry

## VSEPR Theory and Molecular Geometries Structure Determines Properties

+ Audio 0:08:34.357376
+ Structure of Compounds Determines Their Properties
+ Properties of molecular substances depend on the structure of the molecule.
+ The structure includes many factors:
  + The skeletal arrangement of the atoms
  + The kind of bonding between the atoms
+  Ionic, polar covalent, or covalent
  + The shape of the molecule
+  Bonding theory predicts the shapes of molecules.

## What is Molecular Geometry?

+ Audio 0:08:43.125118
+ Molecules are three-dimensional objects.
+ Molecular geometries:
  + Describe the shape of a molecule with terms that relate to geometric figures
  + Have characteristic “corners” that indicate the positions of the surrounding atoms around a central atom in the center of the geometric figure
+ Have characteristic angles that are called *bond angles*

## Lewis Theory

+ Audio 0:09:38.911219
+ Lewis theory predicts there are regions of electron density in an atom. +  These regions of electron density should repel each other
because the regions are negatively charged.
  + Some regions result from placing shared pairs of valence electrons between bonding nuclei.
+ Other regions result from placing unshared valence electrons on a single nuclei.
+ These regions are called “electron groups”
+ Audio 0:10:23.928591
+ This idea can then be extended to predict the shapes of the molecules.
  + The position of atoms surrounding a central atom will be determined by where the bonding electron groups are.
  + The positions of the electron groups will be determined by trying to minimize repulsions between them.

## VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) Theory

+ Audio 0:10:57.562360
+ Electron groups around the central atom will be most stable when they are as far apart as possible.
  + This is the basis for VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) theory.
  + Because electrons are negatively charged, they should be most stable when they are separated as much as possible.
+ The resulting geometric arrangement will allow us to predict the shapes and bond angles in the molecule.

## Electron Groups

+ Audio 0:11:58.852503
+ The Lewis structure predicts the number of valence
electron pairs around the central atoms.
+ Each lone pair of electrons constitutes one electron group
on a central atom.
+ Each bond constitutes one electron group on a central
atom, regardless of whether it is single, double, or triple.
+ Example: NO2
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-03-week-8-day-1-f3c14.png)
  + There are three electron groups on N:
    + Three lone pairs
    + One single bond
    + One double bond

## Electron Group Geometry

+ Audio 0:12:41.207985
+ There are five basic arrangements of electron groups around a
central atom.
  + Arrangements are as follows:
+ Linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, bipyramidal, and octahedral
+ Based on a maximum of six bonding electron groups
  + Though there may be more than six on very large atoms, it is very rare.
+ Each of these five basic arrangements results in five different basic
electron geometries.
  + In order for the molecular shape and bond angles to be a “perfect” geometric figure, all the electron groups must be bonds and all the bonds must be equivalent.
+ For molecules that exhibit resonance, it doesn’t matter which resonance form you use as the electron geometry will be the same

## Five Electron Groups: Trigonal Bipyramidal

+ Audio 0:23:20.082880
Electron Geometry
+ When there are five electron groups around the central atom, they will occupy
positions in the shape of two tetrahedral that are base to base with the central
atom in the center of the shared bases.
  + This results in the electron groups taking a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.
+ The positions above and below the central atom are called the
axial positions.
  + The bond angle between axial and equatorial positions is 90°.
+ The positions in the same base plane as the central atom are called
the equatorial positions.
  + The bond angle between equatorial positions is 120°.

## Octahedral Electron Geometry
+ When there are six electron groups around the central atom, they will occupy positions in the shape of two square-base pyramids that are base-to-base with the central atom in the center of the shared bases.
+ This results in the electron groups taking an octahedral geometry.
  + It is called octahedral because the geometric figure has eight sides.
+ All positions are equivalent.
  + The bond angle is 90°.

## Electron Pair Geometry versus Molecular Geometry

+ The actual geometry of the molecule may be different from the electron geometry.
+ When the electron groups are attached to atoms of different size,
or when the bonding to one atom is different from the bonding to
another, this will affect the molecular geometry around the central
atom.
+ Lone pairs affect the molecular geometry.
+ Lone pair groups: Occupy space on the central atom but are not
“seen” as points on the molecular geometry

## Bent Molecular Geometry: Derivative of Trigonal Planar Electron Geometry

+ Audio 0:33:48.975493
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-03-week-8-day-1-5105d.png)
  + bent
+ + When there are three electron groups around the central atom, and one of them is a lone pair, the resulting shape of the molecule is called a trigonal planar-bent shape.

## Pyramidal and Bent Molecular Geometries: Derivatives of Tetrahedral Electron Geometry

+ Audio 0:34:54.926890
+ When there are four electron groups around the central atom, and one is a lone pair, the result is called a pyramidal shape because it is a triangular-base pyramid with the central atom at the apex.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-03-week-8-day-1-13ffe.png)

## Pyramidal and Bent Molecular Geometries: Derivatives of Tetrahedral Electron Geometry

## Effect of Lone Pairs on Molecular Structure

+ Audio 0:36:21.514009
+ The bonding electrons are shared by two atoms, so some of the negative charge is removed from the central atom.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-10-03-week-8-day-1-cfa24.png)
+ Relative sizes of repulsive force interactions are as follows:
+ Lone	pair	to	Lone	pair	>	Lone	pair	to	Bonding	pair	>	Bonding	pair	to	Bonding	pair
