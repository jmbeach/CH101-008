## Avogadroʼs Law: Volume and Moles Have a Direct Relationship

+ Audio 0:11:31.193983
+ Volume is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules when pressure and temperature are held constant.
  – More gas molecules = larger volume
+ Equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules.
  – The gas doesn't matter.
+ V = constant × n (moles)
+ V/n = constant
+ (V1/n1) = (V2/n2)
+ The volume of a gas sample increases linearly with the number of moles of gas in the sample.

## Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT

+ Audio 0:17:10.738500
+ The simple gas law relationships discussed so far can be combined into a single law that encompasses all of them.
  + V α (1/P) Boyle’s Law
  + V α T Charles’s Law
  + V α n Avogadro’s Law
+ Ideal gas law: PV = nRT
  – Where
    + P is pressure in atm
    + V is volume in liters
    + n is moles
    + R is the ideal gas law constant, 0.0821 (L · atm)/(K · mol)
      – T is temperature in kelvins

## Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT

+ Audio 0:18:31.572724
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-28-week-16-day-1-ac8d5.png)
· The other gas laws are found in the ideal gas law if two variables are kept constant.
· The ideal gas law allows us to find one of the variables if we know the other three.

## Standard Conditions

+ Audio 0:26:03.240956
+ Because the volume of a gas varies with pressure and temperature, chemists have agreed on a set of conditions to report our measurements so that comparison is easy.
  – These are called standard conditions (STP).
+ Standard pressure = 1 atm
+ Standard temperature = 273 K = 0 °C
+ Standard amount = 1 mol
+ Standard volume = 22.4 L
  – The volume occupied by one mole of a substance is its molar volume at STP (T = 273 K or 0 °C and P = 1atm).
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-28-week-16-day-1-87edf.png)

## Molar Volume at STP

+ Audio 0:28:15.214651
+ The volume of one mole of gas at STP is called the molar volume.
  + 6.022 × 1023 molecules of gas
    – Note that the type of gas is immaterial.
+ It is important to recognize that one-mole measures of different gases have different masses, even though they have the same volume.

## Density of a Gas

+ Audio 0:29:06.988437
+ Density is the ratio of mass to volume.
  – Density = (mass/volume)
+ Density of a gas is generally given in grams/liter (g/L).
+ The mass of 1 mol = molar mass.
+ The volume of 1 mol at STP = 22.4 L.
  + Density (d) = [mass of gas (g/mol)]/[volume (L)]
    + Density (g/L) = (molar mass)/(molar volume)

## Density of a Gas at STP

+ Audio 0:29:33.594188
+ For example, the densities of helium and nitrogen gas at STP are as follows:

## Molar Mass of a Gas

+ Audio 0:30:27.999878
+ One of the methods chemists use to determine the molar mass of an unknown substance is to heat a weighed sample until it becomes a gas; measure the temperature, pressure, and volume; and use the ideal gas law.

## Gas Density

+ Audio 0:31:34.143033

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-28-week-16-day-1-61612.png)

## Practice Problem: Density of a Gas

+ Audio 0:34:25.383706
+ A sample of gas has a mass of 0.311 g. Its volume is 0.225 L at 55 oC and pressure of 886 mmHg. What is the molar mass?

## Mixtures of Gases and Partial Pressures

+ Many gas samples are not pure but are mixtures of gases.
+ Dry air, for example, is a mixture containing nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and a few other gases in trace amounts.
+ Therefore, in certain applications, the mixture can be thought of as one gas.
  – By knowing air’s pressure, volume, and temperature, the total moles of molecules in an air sample can be determined—even though they are different compounds.

## Partial Pressure: Pgas

+ Audio 0:38:48.952989
+ The pressure of a single gas in a mixture of gases is called its partial pressure.
+ The partial pressure of a gas can be calculated if
  – a fraction of the mixture it composes and the total pressure are known; or
  – the number of moles of the gas in a container of a given volume and temperature are known.
+ The sum of the partial pressures of all the gases in the mixture equals the total pressure. This is known as Daltonʼs law of partial pressures.
  + Ptotal = Pa + Pb + Pc + …
+ Gases behave independently.

## Partial Pressure: Pgas

+ Audio 0:40:46.362349
+ The pressure due to any individual component in a gas mixture is its partial pressure (Pn).
+ The partial pressure from the ideal gas law can be determined by assuming that each gas component acts independently.
  + RT Pn = nn V
