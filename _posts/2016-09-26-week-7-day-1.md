## Mass Percent as a Conversion Factor

+ Audio 0:01:05.568971

+  the mass percent tells you the mass of a constituent element in 100 g of the compound
  + the fact that CCl2F2 is 58.64% Cl by mass means that 100 g of CCl2F2 contains 58.64 g Cl
+  this can be used as a conversion factor
  + 100 g CCl2F2 : 58.64 g Cl

## Molecular Formulas

+ Audio 0:01:54.462456
+ The molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula
+ Molecular Mass is the same multiple of the mass of the empirical formula
+ Benzene:
+ Empirical Formula: CH
  + 13.02 amu, 13.02 g/mol
+ Molecular Formula: C6H6 which is 6xCH
  + 78.11 amu, 78.11 g/mol

## Determining a Chemical Formula from Experimental Data

+ Audio 0:03:56.552943
Empirical Formula:
+ Simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms of elements in a compound
+  Can be determined from elemental analysis
  +  Masses of elements formed when a compound is decomposed, or that react together to form a compound
+  Combustion analysis
  +  (Mass) Percent composition
    Note: An empirical formula represents a ratio of atoms or a ratio of moles of atoms, not a ratio of masses.

## Finding an Empirical Formula

+ Audio 0:05:56.439211
1. Convert the percentages to grams.
  + a)  If not given, assume you start with 100 g of the compound.
  + b)  Example: 24.5% C means 24.5 g C.
2. Convert mass (grams) to moles.
  a)  Use molar mass of each element.
  b)  Example: 24.5 g C × (1 mol C/12.01 grams) = 2.00 mol C
3. Divide all by the smallest number of moles to obtain the atom- to-atom ratio for each of the elements in the compound.
  a)  If the result is within 0.1 of a whole number, round to the whole number.
4. Multiply all mole ratios by a number to make all whole numbers.
  a)  If ratio is .5, multiply all by 2; if the ratio is .33 or .67, multiply all by 3; and so on.
  b) Skip if already whole numbers.

## Example

+ What is the empirical formula of a substance that contains 5.28 g of C, 1.11 g of H, and 3.52 g of O?

A) C2H5O
B) C2H4O2
C) C2H4O3
D) C3H4O4

+ Answer is A

## Combustion Analysis

+  A common technique for analyzing compounds is to burn a known mass of compound and weigh the amounts of product made.
  +  This is generally used for organic compounds containing C, H, or O.

+ Audio 0:22:35.779419
+ Ex: you combust 11.5 g ethanol and collect 22.0 g CO2 and 13.5 g H2O.

+  By knowing the mass of the product and composition of constituent element in the product, the original amount of constituent element can be determined.
  +  All the original C forms CO2, the original H forms H2O, and the original mass of O is found by subtraction.
+  Once the masses of all the constituent elements in the original compound have been determined, the empirical formula can be found.

## Clicker

what is the empirical formula of the compound with the following composition?
2.1 % H, 65.3 % O, 32.6% S (H: 1.008, O: 16, S: 32.06)
+ C2H5O

## Example 5.16 + Find the molecular formula of butanedione

+ Given: emp. form. = C2H3O; MM = 86.09 g/mol
+ Find: molecular formula
  + C4H6O2

## Carbon Bonding

+ Audio 0:39:10.776833
+ carbon atoms bond almost exclusively covalently
  + compounds with ionic bonding C are generally inorganic
+  when C bonds, it forms 4 covalent bonds
  + 4 single bonds, 2 double bonds, 1 triple + 1
single, etc.
+  carbon can form limitless chains of C atoms, both straight and branched, and rings of C atoms

## Classifying Organic Compounds

+  there are two main
categories of organic compounds, hydrocarbons and functionalized hydrocarbons
+  hydrocarbons contain only C and H
+  most fuels are mixtures of hydrocarbons

## Classifying Hydrocarbons

+ Audio 0:41:37.320899
+  hydrocarbons containing only single
bonds are called alkanes
+  hydrocarbons containing one or more
C=C are called alkenes
+  hydrocarbons containing one or more
C=C are called alkynes
+  hydrocarbons containing C6 “benzene” ring are called aromatic
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-26-week-7-day-1-6ad67.png)

## Naming Straight Chain Hydrocarbons

+ Base name to indicate the number of carbons in the chain
+ suffix to indicate class and position of multiple bonds suffix –ane for alkane, –ene for alkene, –yne for alkyne
