# Covalent Bonding

+ Audio 0:04:33.001883

## Covalent Bonding: Bonding and Lone Pair Electrons

+ Audio 0:05:07.718537
+  Electrons that are shared by atoms are called bonding pairs.
+  Electrons that are not shared by atoms but belong to a particular atom are called
lone pairs.
  +  Also known as nonbonding pairs
+ Audio 0:06:48.740545
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-733d5.png)
  + The top and bottom electrons on the O atom are lone pairs

## Single Covalent Bonds

+ Audio 0:07:48.556923
+  When two atoms share one pair of electrons, the result is called a single covalent bond.
  +  Two electrons
+  One atom may use more than one single bond to fulfill
its octet.
  +  To different atoms +  H only duet

## Double Covalent Bond

+ Audio 0:09:16.705706
+  When two atoms share two pairs of electrons, the result is called a double covalent bond.
  + Four electrons between the two atoms
    +  Example: O2
      + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-6c063.png)
+ Audio 0:10:33.321892
+  Elements that can double-bond with each other and themselves are C, N, O, S, and P

## Triple Covalent Bond

+ Audio 0:11:13.222743
+  When two atoms share three pairs of electrons, the result is called a *triple covalent bond*.
  + Six electrons between the two atoms
    +  Example: N2
      + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-d5e5a.png)
+  Elements that can triple-bond with each other and themselves are C, N, O, and S.

## Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality

+ Audio 0:13:08.879773
+  Lewis theory
  +  implies that some combinations should be stable,
  whereas others should not.
    +  Stable combinations result in “octets.”
  +  allows us to predict the formulas of molecules of covalently bonded substances.
    +  Hydrogen and the halogens are all diatomic molecular elements, as predicted by Lewis theory.
    +  Oxygen generally forms either two single bonds or a double bond in its molecular compounds.
      + There are some stable compounds in which oxygen has one single bond and another in which it has a triple bond, but it still has an octet.

## Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality

+ Audio 0:14:51.981353
+  Lewis theory of covalent bonding
  +  implies that the attractions between atoms are
*directional*.
    +  The shared electrons are most stable between the
bonding atoms.
  +  predicts that covalently bonded compounds will be found as individual molecules.
    +  Rather than an array like ionic compounds
      + *Compounds of nonmetals are made of individual molecule units*.

## Molecular Compounds: Formulas and Names

+ Audio 0:16:15.133336
+  Molecular compounds are composed of two or more nonmetals.
+  The formula for a molecular compound cannot readily be determined from its constituent elements because the same combination of elements may form many different molecular compounds, each with a different formula.
  + Nitrogen and oxygen form all of the following unique molecular compounds:
    + NO, NO2, N2O, N2O3, N2O4, and N2O5.

## Molecular Compounds

+ Audio 0:17:43.500253
+  Names of Molecular Compounds:
  + Write the name of the element with the smallest group number first.
  + If the two elements lie in the same group, then write the element with the greatest row number first.
  + The prefixes given to each element indicate the number of atoms present.

## Binary Molecular Compounds

+ Audio 0:18:59.257994
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-4da3e.png)
+ These prefixes are the same as those used in hydrates:

| Prefix | Number |
| --- | --- |
| mono | 1 |
| di | 2 |
| tri | 3 |
| tetra | 4 |
| penta | 5 |
| hexa | 6 |
| hepta | 7 |
| octa | 8 |
| nona | 9 |
| deca | 10 |

+ If there is only one atom of the first element in the formula, the prefix mono- is normally omitted

## Molecular Compounds

+ Audio 0:20:34.443243

| molecule | name |
| HI | hydrogen iodide |
| NF_3 | nitrogen trifluoride |
| SO_2 | suffer dioxide |
| N_2Cl_4 | dinitrogen tetrachloride |
| NO_2 | nitrogen dioxide |
| N_2O | dinitrogen monoxide |

## Mass

+ Audio 0:23:26.555568
+ *Molecular mass* (or molecular weight) is the sum of the atomic masses (in amu) in a molecule
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-abe79.png)

## Another Molecular Mass Example

+ Audio 0:25:48.242857
+ What is the Molecular Mass of C3H8O ?
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-d7aac.png)

## Clicker question

+ Find the molecular weight of  urea (CH4N2O)
  + (All but 1% got it right)

## Using Molar Mass to Count Molecules by Weighing

+ Audio 0:28:43.992973
+  Molar mass in combination with Avogadro’s number can be used to determine the number of atoms in a given mass of the element.
  +  Use molar mass to convert to the amount in moles. Then use Avogadro’s number to convert to number of molecules.

## Using Molecular Mass

+ Audio 0:39:35.097586
+ How many H atoms are in 72.5 g of C3H8O ?
+ *Mass percent composition* of an element in a compound =
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-44554.png)
  + n is the number of moles of the element in 1 mole of the compound
  + ![](../../../assets/2016-09-23-week-6-day-3-65070.png)
+ Audio 0:42:11.330892
+ What is the mass percent of Ca in CaCl2
+  CaCl2 (Ca = 40.08, Cl = 35.45)
