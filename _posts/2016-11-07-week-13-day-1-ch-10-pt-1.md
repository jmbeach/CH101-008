## Nature of Energy, Work, and Heat

+ Audio 0:03:40.491883
+ *Energy* is anything that has the capacity to do work.
  + Think of *energy* as a quantity an object or collection of objects can possess
  + Energy can be exchanged between objects through contact.
  + For example:
    + through collisions
+ *Work* is a force acting over a distance.
  + Energy = work = force × distance
+ *Heat* is the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature.
+ Think of heat and work as the two different ways that an object can exchange energy with other objects.
  + Either out of it, or into it

## Classification of Energy

+ Audio 0:06:25.636622
+ *Kinetic energy* is energy of motion or energy that is being transferred.
+ *Thermal energy* is the energy associated with temperature.
  + Thermal energy is a form of kinetic energy.

## Classification of Energy

+ Audio 0:08:21.249403
+ *Potential energy* is energy that is stored in an object or energy associated with the composition and position of the object.
  + Audio 0:09:49.310141
  + Energy stored in the structure of a compound is potential energy.

## Manifestations of Energy

## Some Forms of Energy

+ Audio 0:13:00.066117
+ Heat or thermal energy
  + Kinetic energy associated with molecular motion
+ Electrical
  + Kinetic energy associated with the flow of electrical charge
+ Light or radiant energy
  + Kinetic energy associated with energy transitions in an atom
+ Nuclear
  + Potential energy in the nucleus of atoms
+ Chemical
  + Potential energy due to the structure of the atoms, the attachment between atoms, the atoms’ positions relative to each other in a molecule, or the molecules’ relative positions in the structure

## Units of Energy

+ Audio 0:14:08.320504
+ The amount of kinetic energy an object has is directly proportional to its mass and velocity.
  + KE = ½mv2
+ When the mass is in kg and velocity is in m/s, the unit for kinetic energy is a *joule* (J).
  + 1 J = kg m2/s2 = 1 N m
  + 1 joule of energy is the amount of energy needed to move a 1 kg mass at a speed of 1 m/s.
+ A *calorie* (cal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 °C.
  + 1 kcal = energy needed to raise 1000 g of water 1 °C
+ A food Calorie (Cal) is 1000 calories.
  + 1 kcal is equivalent to ONE food Calorie = kcals.

## Conversion between Energy Units

## Conservation of Energy

+ Audio 0:18:02.274506
+ The *law of conservation of energy* states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.
+ When energy is transferred between objects, or converted from one form to another, the total amount of energy present at the beginning must be present at the end.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-07-week-13-day-1-ch-10-pt-1-2f303.png)

## System and Surroundings

+ *System* is defined as the material within which the process we are studying happens.
+ *Surroundings* are defined as everything else with which the system can exchange energy.
+ *Thermodynamics* is the study of energy that is exchanged between the system and the surroundings.
  + Energy can flow from the system to the surroundings.
    + Energy of the system drops; energy of surroundings increases.
    + *Exothermic* (flow out of system)
  + Energy can flow into the system from the surroundings.
    + Energy of the system increases; energy of the surroundings decreases.
    + *Endothermic* (flow into system)

## Comparing the Amount of Energy in the System and Surroundings during Transfer

+ Audio 0:24:03.313606
+ Conservation of energy means that the amount of energy gained or lost by the system has to be equal to the amount of energy lost or gained by the surroundings.

## The First Law of Thermodynamics: Law of Conservation of Energy

+ *Thermodynamics* is the study of energy and its interconversions.
+ Audio 0:24:58.285011
+ The first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy.
  + This means that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant.
  + Therefore, you can never build a system that will continue to produce energy without some source of energy.

## Energy Flow and Conservation of Energy

+ Audio 0:26:06.301332
+ Conservation of energy requires that the sum of the energy changes in the system and the surroundings must be zero.
+ Change(energyuniverse) = 0
  + =Change(Energysystem) + Change(Energysurroundings)
  + ΔEnergyuniverse = 0 = ΔEnergysystem + ΔEnergysurroundings
  + Δ is the symbol that is used to mean change.
    + – Final amount – initial amount

## Internal Energy

+ Audio 0:27:47.890733
+ The *internal energy* is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all of the particles that compose the system.
+ The change in the internal energy of a system only depends on the amount of energy in the system at the
beginning and end.
  + ΔE = Efinal – Einitial
  + ΔEreaction = Eproducts − Ereactants
+ A *state function* is a mathematical function whose result only depends on the initial and final conditions, not on the process used.
+ It is an *Extensive Property* –depends upon the amount of material

## State Function

+ To reach the top of the mountain, there are two trails:
  + 1. Long and winding
  + 2. Short but steep
+ Regardless of the trail, when you reach the top, you will be 10,000 ft above the base.
+ The distance from the base to the peak of the mountain is a state function. It depends only on the difference in elevation between the base and the peak, not on how you arrive there!

## In Summary:

+ Audio 0:33:20.823776
+ If the reactants have a higher internal energy than the products:
  + ΔEsys is said to be negative because energy flows OUT of the system into the surroundings.
+ If the reactants have a lower internal energy than the products:
  + ΔEsys is said to be positive because energy flows INTO the system from the surroundings.
+ The internal energy of the system can be thought in a similar manner.
  + Energy flowing out of the system is like a withdrawal and therefore carries a negative sign.
  + Energy flowing into the system is like a deposit and carries a positive sign.

## Energy Exchange

+ Audio 0:34:35.272796
+ Energy is exchanged between the system and surroundings through heat and work.
  + *q* = heat (thermal) energy
  + *w* = work energy
  + q and w are NOT state functions; their value depends on the process.
    + ΔE = q + w

## Energy Exchange

+ Audio 0:35:29.581181
+ Chemists are “System Oriented” so energy gained by system is positive, energy lost is negative
+ doesn’t matter if it is heat flow or work
+ (Older) engineering convention where heat flow in is positive and work out is positive
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-07-week-13-day-1-ch-10-pt-1-6ea49.png)

## Heat Exchange

+ Audio 0:36:39.238039
+ *Heat* is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and surroundings.
+ Heat exchange occurs when system and surroundings have a difference in temperature.
+ *Temperature* is the measure of the thermal energy within a sample of matter.
+ Heat flows from matter with high temperature to matter with low temperature until both objects reach the same temperature.
  + Thermal equilibrium

## Quantity of Heat Energy Absorbed: Heat Capacity

+ Audio 0:38:11.929773
+ When a system absorbs heat, its temperature increases.
+ The increase in temperature is directly proportional to
the amount of heat absorbed.
+ The proportionality constant is called the *heat
 capacity, C*.
  + q = C × ΔT
  + Units of C are J/°C or J/K.
+ The larger the heat capacity of the object being studied, the smaller the temperature rise will be for a given amount of heat.

## Factors Affecting Heat Capacity

+ The heat capacity of an object depends on its amount of matter.
  + Directly proportional to mass.
  + 200 g of water requires twice as much heat to raise its temperature by 1 °C as does 100 g of water.
+ The heat capacity of an object depends on the type of material.
  + 1000 J of heat energy will raise the temperature of 100 g of sand 12 °C, but only raise the temperature of 100 g of water by 2.4 °C.

## Clicker 2

+ Which of the following signs on q and w represent a system that is doing work on the surroundings, as well as gaining heat from the surroundings?
  + A) q=+, w=-
  + B) q = -, w = +
  + C) q = +, w = +
  + D) q = -, w = -
  + E) None of these represent the system referenced
