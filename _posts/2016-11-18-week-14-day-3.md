## Standard Conditions and Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)

+ Audio 0:00:21.144316
+ The *standard state* is the state of a material at a defined set of conditions.
  + Pure gas at exactly 1 atm pressure
  + Pure solid or liquid in its most stable form at exactly 1 atm pressure and temperature of interest
    + Usually 25 °C
  + Substance in a solution with concentration 1 M
+ The *standard enthalpy change*, ΔH°, is the enthalpy change when all reactants and products are in their standard states.
  + Audio 0:02:59.978786
+ The *standard enthalpy of formation, ΔH°f*, is the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of a pure compound from its constituent elements.
  + The elements must be in their standard states.
  + The ΔHf° for a pure element in its standard state = 0 kJ/mol.

## Calculating Standard Enthalpy Change for a Reaction

+ Audio 0:12:36.053007
+ Any reaction can be written as the sum of formation reactions (or the reverse of formation reactions) for the reactants and products.
+ The ΔH° for the reaction is then the sum of the ΔHf° for the component reactions. ΔH° reaction = ∑nΔHf °(products) − ∑nΔHf °(reactants) ∑ means sum. n is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reaction.

+ C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g) ΔHf°= − 74.6 kJ/mol CH4
+ C(s, graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g) ΔHf°= −393.5 kJ/mol CO2
+ H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(g) ΔHf° = −241.8 kJ/mol H2O

## Ionic Bonding and the Crystal Lattice

+ Audio 0:26:20.219643
+ The extra energy that is released comes from the formation of a structure in which every cation is surrounded by anions, and vice versa.
+ This structure is called a crystal lattice.
+ The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.
+ The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between cations and anions, leading to the most stable arrangement.

## Lattice Energy

+ The extra stability that accompanies the formation of the crystal lattice is measured as the lattice energy.
+ The lattice energy is the energy released when the solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.
  + Always exothermic
  + Hard to measure directly, but can be calculated from knowledge of other processes
+ Lattice energy depends directly on the size of charges and inversely on distance between ions.

## Determining Lattice Energy: The Born–Haber Cycle

+ The *Born–Haber cycle* is a hypothetical series of reactions that represents the formation of an ionic compound from its constituent elements.
+ The reactions are chosen so that the change in enthalpy of each reaction is known except for the last one, which is the lattice energy.

## Born–Haber Cycle and Hess’s Law

+ ![](../../../assets/2016-11-18-week-14-day-3-ca0e4.png)
+ Use Hess’s law to add up enthalpy changes of other reactions to determine the lattice energy.

## Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Size

+ Audio 0:31:13.639819
+ The force of attraction between charged particles is inversely proportional to the distance between them.
+ Larger ions mean the center of positive charge (nucleus of the cation) is farther away from the negative charge (electrons of the anion).
  + Larger ion = weaker attraction
  + Weaker attraction = smaller lattice energy

## Lattice Energy versus Ion Size

+ Audio 0:31:57.501608
+ The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges.
+ Larger charge means the ions are more strongly attracted.
  + Larger charge = stronger attraction
  + Stronger attraction = larger lattice energy

## Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Charge

+ The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges.
+ Larger charge means the ions are more strongly attracted.
  + Larger charge = stronger attraction
  + Stronger attraction = larger lattice energy
+ Of the two factors, ion charge is generally more important.
