## Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA) for Main-Group Elements

+ Audio 0:07:24.054226
+ Electron Affinity:
  + It is the energy associated with the addition of an electron to the valence shell of an atom that is in the gas phase.
    + M(g)+1e− →M1−(g)+EA
+ It is defined as exothermic (−) the release of energy. But
may actually be endothermic (+) taking energy.
  + Some alkali earth metals’ and all noble gases’ electron affinities are endothermic.
+ The more energy that is released, the larger the electron affinity.
  + The more negative the number, the larger the EA.

## Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA)

+ Audio 0:08:45.799510
+ General Trend for Main-Group Elements
  + EA increases across a period.
    + EA becomes more negative from left to right.

## Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA) for Main-Group Elements

+ Audio 0:10:58.796812
+ Summarizing Electron Affinity for Main-Group Elements
  + Most groups (columns) of the periodic table do not exhibit any definite trend in electron affinity.
+ Among the group 1A metals, however, electron affinity becomes more positive as we move down the column (adding an electron becomes less exothermic).
  + Alkali metals (group 1A) decrease electron affinity down the column.
+ Generally irregular increase in EA from second period to third period
  + Group 5A generally has lower EA than expected because extra electron must pair up.
  + Groups 2A and 8A generally have very low EA because added electron goes into higher energy level or sublevel.
+ Electron affinity generally becomes more negative (adding an electron becomes more exothermic) as we move to the right across a period (row) in the periodic table.

## Lewis Theory Predictions for Ionic Bonding

+ Audio 0:44:41.987239
•  Lewis theory predicts the number of electrons a metal atom should lose or a nonmetal atom should gain in order to attain a stable electron arrangement.

–  formulas of ionic compounds that result;
–  relative strengths of the resulting ionic bonds based on Coulomb’s law.

## Octet Rule: A Guideline for Molecule Formation

•  Exceptions to the octet rule:
–  H, Li, Be, and B attain an electron configuration like that of He.
•  He can have ONLY two valence electrons, a duet.
•  Li loses its one valence electron.
•  H shares orgainsoneelectron.
–  Though it commonly loses its one electron to become H+
•  BelosestwoelectronstobecomeBe2+.
–  Though it commonly shares its two electrons in covalent bonds, resulting
in four valence electrons
•  BlosesthreeelectronstobecomeB3+.
–  Though it commonly shares its three electrons in covalent bonds, resulting in six valence electrons

## Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation: Using NaCl as an Example

+ Audio 0:47:21.944874
The ionization energy of the metal is endothermic.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-19-week-6-day-1-ada36.png)
+ The electron affinity of the nonmetal is exothermic.
+ ![](../../../assets/2016-09-19-week-6-day-1-1841b.png)
+ Generally, the ionization energy of the metal is larger than the electron affinity of the nonmetal; therefore, the formation of the ionic compound should be endothermic.
+ But the heat of formation of most ionic compounds is exothermic and generally large.
