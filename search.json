Audio 0:27:22.163854      Some of Wednesday’s lecture will be review      Also, there’s practice on the MyLabsPlus website      Emission Spectra  Audio 0:28:51.812590    Light had been thought of as a wave for a long time and now it’s being thought of as particles          People were asking why is light emitted and absorbed in fixed quantities?      Examples of Spectra  Audio 0:30:24.253251    Each element has its own emission spectrum  All of this points to atoms emitting and absorbing light / energy in discrete packetsThe Bohr Model of the Atom  Audio 0:31:23.054768  The nuclear model of the atom (Rutherford model) does not explain what structural changes occur when the atom gains or loses energy.          He hypothesized that only certain orbits are allowed and came up with a model which predicted what was observed        Bohr developed a model of the atom to explain how the structure of the atom changes when it undergoes energy transitions.  Bohr’s major idea was that the energy of the atom was quantized, and that the amount of energy in the atom was related to the electron’s position in the atom.          Quantized means that the atom could have only very specific amounts of energy.      Bohr’s Model  Audio 0:32:22.750198  The electrons travel in orbits that are at a fixed distance from the nucleus.          Found different shapes of orbits      Stationary states      Therefore, the energy of the electron was proportional to the distance the orbit was from the nucleus.        Electrons emit radiation when they “jump” from an orbit with higher energy down to an orbit with lower energy.          Audio 0:32:58.969212      The emitted radiation was a photon of light.      The distance between the orbits determined the energy of the photon of light produced.

Interference Types:          Constructive interference: waves that interact so that they make a larger wave are said to be in phase                                      Destructive interference: Waves that interact so that they cancel each other out are said to be out of phase                                      Two-Slit Interference  Audio 0:38:15.810042    Diffraction pattern          Either it goes through a slit or it doesn’t      Wave Behavior Properties: Diffraction  Audio 0:38:41.975443  When traveling waves encounter an obstacle or opening in a barrier that is about the same size as the wavelength, they bend around it; this is called diffraction.          Traveling particles do not diffract        The diffraction of light through two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wavelength results in an interference pattern of the diffracted waves.  An interference pattern is a characteristic of all light waves.  Wave Behavior of Electrons  Audio 0:39:38.320960  De Broglie proposed that particles could have wavelike character.  De Broglie predicted that the wavelength of a particle was inversely proportional to its momentum.  Because it is so small, the wave character of electrons is significant.  De Broglie relation                Example problem  Audio 0:40:32.639227  What are the de Broglie wavelengths (in nm) associated with an electron traveling at 6.0 * 10^5 ms-1 and a 52.5 g Ping-Pong ball traveling at 15.6 m/s?

Chapter 3  Audio 0:18:47.526137Properties of Waves  Audio 0:19:09.721677    Wavelength (λ) is the distance between identical points on successive waves.  Amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline of a wave to the peak or trough.  Audio 0:20:20.914304    Frequency (ν) is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in 1 second (Hz = 1 cycle/s).  Audio 0:21:32.710413  The speed (v) of the wave = λ x νLight  Audio 0:23:42.023732  Amplitude and Wavelength  Audio 0:24:52.722734  Wavelength and amplitude are independent properties.          The wavelength of light determines its color (intensive physical property).        The amplitude, or intensity, determines its brightness (extensive physical property)          Brightness dependent on amplitude        Color  Audio 0:26:15.944132  The color of light is determined by its wavelength or frequency.  White light is a mixture of all the colors of visible light.          A spectrum      Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet        When an object absorbs some of the wavelengths of white light and reflects others, it appears colored; the observed color is predominantly the colors reflected.Maxwell  Audio 0:26:23.185612  Maxwell (1873), proposed that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves.  Electromagnetic Spectrum  Audio 0:29:13.853883  Example problem  Audio 0:30:56.499318  An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 6.0 x 10^4 Hz. Does this frequency fall in the visible region? Convert this frequency into wavelength (nm).                Clicker Question  Audio 0:34:13.178546  What is the wave length of a wave with frequency 8.6 * 10^13 Hz?  Einstein and the Photoelectronic Effect  Audio 0:39:00.844561  Hertz observed that when (some) light shines on a metal surface, electrons are produced from the surface.          The electrons emitted from the metal surface are photoelectrons.      This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect.              Audio 0:40:20.734175          Number of electrons depends upon light intensity      More Kinetic energy at higher frequency of light      Emission has a frequency threshold, below which there are no electrons        Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:05.218727  Classic theory explanation:          The photoelectric effect according to classic wave theory attributed the electrons’ being emitted from the metal surface to the light energy being transferred to the electrons.      Classic theory states the following:                  If the wavelength of light is made shorter or the light wave’sintensity is made brighter, more electrons should be ejected.          Energy of a wave is directly proportional to its amplitude and its frequency.                          Example: If a dim light is used there should be a lag time before electrons are emitted in order to give the electrons time to absorb enough energy.                                          Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:13.093629  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Experimental observations indicate the following:                  A minimum frequency was needed before electrons would be emitted regardless of the intensity called the threshold frequency.          High-frequency light from a dim source caused electron emission without any lag time.                    Einstein’s idea: “Light Is Quantized.”  Audio 0:43:33.274758  Ejection of electrons from a metal surface by light:          One photon at the threshold frequency gives the electron just enough energy for it to escape the atom.      Binding energy, φ      When irradiated with a shorter wavelength photon, the electron absorbs more energy than is necessary to escape.      This excess energy becomes kinetic energy of the ejected electron.                                      Where (hυ) is a quantized packet of energy      Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Einstein proposed that the light energy was delivered to the atoms in packets called quanta or photons.                  Energy = (hυ)                          hυ = quanta                                          The energy of a photon of light is directly proportional to its frequency.                  E = hc/λ          Or it is inversely proportional to its wavelength.                    Symbols:                  Planck’s Constant, (h) is a proportionality constant with a value of h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s.          Speed of light (c) value is 3.00 × 108 m/s                    Black Body Radiation  Audio 0:46:37.258672    If you heat something up in the dark, you can see it with infrared radiation  “Black Body Problem” Solved by Planck in 1900“… an act of despair … I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics …”Energy (light) is emitted or absorbed in discrete units (quantum).

Ex: How many mL are in 1.63 L?  Ex: The speed of sound in air is about 343 m/s. What is this speed in miles per hour? (1 mile = 1.609 km)  Audio 0:20:52.486829  What is a Mole?  Audio 0:23:59.232240  A mole is a scientist’s “baker’s dozen.”          When we count large numbers of objects, we often use units such as                  1 dozen objects = 12 objects          1 gross objects = 144 objects.                      A mole (mol) of anything contains 6.02214 × 1023 pieces.          Examples:                  1 mol of marbles corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 marbles.          1 mol of sand grains corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 sand grains.                      This number is Avogadro’s number.The Mole  Audio 0:26:54.511808  The second, and more fundamental, thing to understand about the mole is how it gets its specific value.  The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of pure C-12.  12 g C = 1 mol C atoms = 6.022×10^23 C atomsMole Conversions: Atoms to Moles or Moles to Atoms  Audio 0:28:02.694268  Converting between number of moles and number of atoms is similar to converting between dozens of eggs and number of eggs.  For atoms, you use the conversion factor 1 mol atoms = 6.022 × 1023 atoms.

Most of the volume of the atom is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively charged electrons are dispersed.      There are many negatively charged electrons outside the nucleus as there are positively charged particles (named protons) within the nucleus, so that the atom is electrically neutral.

The mass of the electron is 9.1 × 10^31 kg.        The charge of the proton and the charge of the electron are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. The neutron has no charge.Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:21:17.788117  Elements: Defined by Their Numbers of Protons  The most important number to the identity of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus.  The number of protons defines the element.  The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is itsatomic number and is given the symbol Z.Isotopes: Elements with Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:24:33.380011  All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; however, they do not necessarily have the same number of neutrons.          Example:                  All neon atoms contain 10 protons, but theymay contain 10, 11, or 12 neutrons.          All three types of neon atoms exist, and each has a slightly different mass.                                Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:26:45.772174  The sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is its mass number and is represented by the symbol A.    X is the chemical symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:28:13.708943  A second common notation for isotopes is the chemical symbol (or chemical name) followed by a dash and the mass number of the isotope.  Isotopes: Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:28:56.545513  The relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a given element is roughly constant.  The percentages are called the natural abundance of the isotopes.  Clicker Question  Audio 0:32:59.698445  What is the atomic number (Z), mass number (A), of chlorine with 18 neutrons?  Z = 17, A = 35 (or 17 + 18)Ions: Charged Atoms Losing and Gaining Electrons  Audio 0:34:19.624557  The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus (designated by its atomic number Z).  In chemical changes, however, atoms can lose or gain electrons and become charged particles called ions.          Positively charged ions are called cations.                  Metal elements, such as Na+, form cations.                    Negatively charged ions are called anions.                  Nonmetal elements, such as F–, form anions.                    Atomic Mass: The Average Mass of an Element’s Atoms  Audio 0:36:03.449187  Atomic mass is sometimes called the atomic weight or standard atomic weight.  The atomic mass of each element is directly beneath the element’s symbol in the periodic table.  The atomic mass of an element represents the average mass of the isotopes that compose that element          It is a weighted value based on the element’s natural abundance of each isotope.          Audio 0:36:29.805279  Mass Spectrometry: Measuring the Mass of Atoms and Molecules  The masses of atoms and the percent abundances of isotopes of elements are measured using mass spectrometry—a technique that separates particles according to their mass.

Democritus wrote, “Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.”                  He proposed that atoms existed in different shapes and sizes and moved randomly through empty space.                      Plato and Aristotle did not embrace the atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          They held that matter had no smallest parts.      They proposed that different substances were composed of various proportions of fire, air, earth, and water.      Early Building Blocks of Matter Ideas  Audio 0:24:38.965354  An English chemist, John Dalton (1766–1844) offered convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          Dalton’s atomic theory of matter        Modern Atomic Theory and Its Laws:          Law of conservation of mass      Law of definite proportions      Law of multiple proportions      John Dalton and the Atomic Theory  John Dalton and the Atomic Theory          Each element is composed of tiny indestructible particles called atoms.      All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements      Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds      Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, atoms change only the way that they are bound together with other atoms.      The Law of Conservation of Mass  Audio 0:27:20.929720  Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conservation of mass, which states the following:          In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.        When a chemical reaction occurs, the total mass of the substances involved in the reaction does not change.          This law is consistent with the idea that matter is composed of small, indestructible particles.        Audio 0:28:53.424491  The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:29:25.280225  In 1797 a French chemist named Joseph Proust made observations on the composition of compounds  He summarized his observations in the law of definite proportions:          All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent elements.        The law of definite proportions is sometimes called the law of constant composition.An Example of the Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:02.047142  The decomposition of 18.0 g of water (H2O) results in 16.0 g of oxygen (O2) and 2.0 g of hydrogen (H2)  an oxygen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 8:1.  Problem Solving: The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:39.294000  Two samples of carbon dioxide decompose into their constituent elements. One produces 25.6 g oxygen and 9.60 g carbon, the other 21.6 g oxygen, and 8.10 g carbon. Show that these results are consistent with the law of definite proportions.The Law of Multiple Proportions  Audio 0:34:08.719405  In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions:          When two elements (call them A and B) form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine with 1 g of element A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.                  When an atom of A combines with either one, two, three, or more atoms of B, the following molecular compounds are possible: AB1, AB2, AB3, etc.                      Audio 0:36:00.257154  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are two compounds composed of the same two elements: carbon and oxygen.                The mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1; therefore, 2.67 g of oxygen reacts with 1 g of carbon.      In carbon monoxide, however, the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon is 1.33:1, or 1.33 g of oxygen to every 1 g of carbon.        The ratio of these two masses is itself a small whole number                Problem Solving: The Law of Multiple Proportions  Nitrogen forms a number of compounds with oxygen. Measurements of the masses of nitrogen and oxygen that form upon decomposing these compounds show that nitrogen dioxide contains 2.28 g oxygen to every 1.00 g of nitrogen, while dinitrogen monoxide contains 0.570 g oxygen to every 1.00 g nitrogen. Show that the results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions:                            4 is a small whole number which coincides with the law of multiple proportions                    The Structure of the AtomThe Discovery of the Electron  Audio 0:41:57.987686  From J. J. Thomson’s (1856–1940) cathode rays experiments, it was observed that          a beam of particles, called cathode rays, traveled from the negatively charged electrode (called the cathode) to the positively charged one (called the anode);      the particles that compose the cathode ray have the following properties:                  They travel in straight lines.          They are independent of the composition of the material from which they originate (the cathode).          They carry a negative electrical charge.                      J.J. Thomson was able to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles by deflecting them using electric and magnetic fields, as shown in the figure on the bottom of the next slide.          The value he measured was –1.76 × 103 coulombs per gram. © 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.

An element is a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.          Basic building blocks of matter      Composed of single type of atom, like helium        A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions.  Most elements are chemically reactive and combine with other elements to form compounds.Heterogeneous Mixture  A heterogeneous mixture is one in which the composition varies from one region of the mixture to another.          Made of multiple substances, whose presence can be seen (example: a salt and sand mixture)                  Portions of a sample of a heterogeneous mixture have different composition and properties.                    Homogeneous Mixture  A homogeneous mixture is one made of multiple substances, but it appears to be one substance.  All portions of a sample have the same composition and properties (like sweetened tea).  Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Audio 0:12:42.707245  The approach to scientific knowledge is empirical  It is based on observation and experimentation.  The scientific method is a process for understanding nature by observing nature and its behavior through experimentation.  Key characteristics of the scientific method          Observations      Formulation of hypotheses      Experimentation      Formulation of laws and theories      Observations  Observations:          They are also known as data.      They are the descriptions about the characteristics or behavior of nature.        Observations, verification of observations, and experimentation can lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Scientists try to understand the universe through empirical knowledge gained through observation and experimentGathering Empirical Knowledge ─ Observation  Some observations are descriptions of the characteristics or behavior of nature ─ qualitative  Some observations compare a characteristic to a standard numerical scale ─ quantitativeFrom Observation to Understanding  Audio 0:15:58.585935  Hypothesis – a tentative interpretation or explanation for an observation  A good hypothesis is one that can be tested to be proved wrong!Testing Ideas  Audio 0:17:57.155168  Ideas in science are tested with experiments  An experiment is a set of highly controlled procedures designed to test whether an idea about nature is valid  The experiment generates observations that will either validate or invalidate the ideaIs this a good hypothesis?  Audio 0:19:00.330922  Yesterday, the phase of the moon was a crescent. I observed that it rained a lot yesterday.  It also rained during the previous crescent moon.  I hypothesize that crescent moons cause rain showers          The hypothesis is the ‘why?’        My answer: This is a good hypothesis because it can be tested and proved wrong  Audio 0:21:04.453540  Best answer: C          It’s a good hypothesis because it’s falsifiable      Audio 0:23:23.754722      Audio 0:25:56.261455      Good reasons to understand the importance of hypothesis      From Specific to General Understanding  Audio 0:26:25.458523  A hypothesis is a potential explanation for a single or small number of observations  A scientific theory is a general explanation for why things in nature are the way they are and behave the way they do          Integrates a lot of different observations      Lets us predict what’s happening in the universe      Think about it  Given what you just learned about the term “Theory”, what’s wrong with this statement:          “The theory of gravity is just a theory and therefore probably wrong”                  Audio 0:27:55.076377          By the time you get to calling things theories, they have been tested a lot                          The scientific method says you can’t prove anything, you can only disprove things              You’ll have to explain exceptions to the theory at some point so a new theory will emerge                                          From Specific to General Observations  A scientific law is a statement that summarizes all past observations and predicts future observations          Law of Conservation of Mass – “In a chemical reaction matter is neither created nor destroyed.”        A scientific law allows you to predict future observations            Audio 0:31:28.593326      Relationships Between Pieces of the Scientific Method  The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  It is necessary to be careful with the information presented by an experimentalist who lacks theoretical principles… [he] gathers at random several facts and presents them as proofs… scientific knowledge without reasoning [theory] does not exist.”          J. le R. d’Alembert (1717-1783), from Nouvelles Experiences sur la Resistance des Fluids. Jombert, Paris (1997)        D’Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ….Unfortunately he carried [his]… pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong…          Thomas L. Hankins (1990). Jean D’Alembert: Science and the Enlightenment. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 236. ISBN 2881243991      Why Is Scientific Measurement Important?  Scientific data can be either qualifiable or quantifiable          Qualifiable data are observational                  Subjective in nature          Examples: color, shape                      Quantifiable data are measurable (empirical).

Although the atoms and molecules in a solidvibrate, they do not move around or pasteach other.  Consequently, a solid has a fixed volume andrigid shape.          Ice, aluminum, and diamond are good examplesof solids.      Liquid Matter  In liquid matter, atoms or molecules pack about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each other.  Liquids have fixed volume but not a fixed shape.  Liquids’ ability to flow makes them assume the shape of their container.          Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at room temperature.      Gaseous Matter  In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them.  They are free to move relative to one another.  Fill available space  These qualities make gases compressible.Classification of Matter by Components  Matter can be classified according to its composition: elements, compounds, and mixtures.  a pure substance is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant  a mixture is a substance composed of two or more components in proportions that can vary from one sample to another  Vocab            Term      Definition                  matter      anything that has mass and occupies space (e.g. has volume)              atoms      Basic submicroscopic particles that constitute the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter              molecules      Substances formed when two or more atoms come together (bond) in specific geometric arrangements              chemistry      a discipline that seeks to understand matter and its properties, and the transformations that matter undergoes- particularly between molecules              state      physical form of matter based on what properties it exhibits (i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.

Usually offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.Student Learning OutcomesThe objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles that form the foundations of chemistry.  An understanding of the quantum mechanical model of atoms provides the basis for understanding atomic structure, which in turn predicts the physical and chemical properties of atoms, as illustrated in the periodic table of the elements.  This understanding provides the basis for understanding the nature of chemical bonds: ionic and covalent.  An understanding of chemical bonds in turn provides the basis for predicting the structures of molecules, and a qualitative understanding of chemical reactions.  A quantitative understanding of the energy of atoms and molecules will provide the basis for predicting the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions and the accompanying release or absorption of heat.  The last objective is to be able to quantitatively predict the properties of gases and understand how the speed of molecular motion relates to the chemical and physical properties of gases and gas mixtures.Required Texts  TURNING TECH / NXT CLICKER (Required)  TRO (CUSTOM) / Chemistry: Structure and Properties Package for University of Alabama, 1/e (Required)Exams and AssignmentsExams 1 – 3 will be given on Wednesday September 7th, October 5th and November 9th from 6:30 - 7:50 PM 127 BiologyFinal Exam:  Monday.  December 5th, 2016 11:30 AM—2:00 PM 127 BiologyA. ExamsYou must bring your ACT card, driver’s license, or other photographic identification to all exams in order to receive a grade.  Students are strongly encouraged to take all regularly scheduled exams. However, should you have to miss one of these exams it will become your drop grade.  If you miss a second exam and can provide a written, reasonable excuse, you will be permitted to use your score (calculated as a percent) on the final exam as a makeup score for the test you missed.  No make-up exams will be given.  No programmable calculators, or calculators that solve polynomial equations, language translators, pagers, cell phones or similar electronic devices are allowed.B. QuizzesQuizzes will be given most every non-test week.  Electronic quizzes will be given either in the Wednesday afternoon recitation sessions or in the lecture classes using the Turning Point response units (“Clicker”).  The response units may be purchased in the SUPE Store (in the Ferguson Center).  It is your responsibility to make sure that your response unit is working, including its batteries, and you must bring it to every class meeting and recitation session.  Your lowest two or three quiz scores will be dropped, and the remainder will be used towards a maximum of 50 points; however, all quizzes will count toward your attendance points.  50% of a questions value will be attendance, 50% will be performance. No make-up quizzes will be given.C. HomeworkHomework assignments will be submitted on the Web using MyLabsPlus.  The due dates are listed on the Web site. Typically about 15-20 problems will be assigned per chapter for a total of approximately 150 questions for the semester.  Each assignment will carry equal weight.  The instructions for logging in are available on BlackBoard Learn. Each assignment carry equal weight. Please check your textbook package for extra instructions.Grading Policy            Assignment      Points                  Exam1      100              Exam2      100              Exam3      100              HW      50              Quizzes      50              In-Class      150              Lab      150              Final      700      Grading ScaleA = 90 – 100  B = 80 - 89   C = 70 -  79  D = 60 - 69  F &lt; 60Plus/Minus grading will be used.Policy on Missed Exams &amp; CourseworkExamsStudents are strongly encouraged to take all regularly scheduled exams. However, should you have to miss one of these exams it will become your drop grade.  If you miss a second exam and can provide a written, reasonable excuse, you will be permitted to use your score (calculated as a percent) on the final exam as a makeup score for the test you missed.

Your number of attendances will count towards a maximum of 50 points for in-class performance/participation.  50% of each question will count towards attendance and 50% towards performance. There will be 5 drops given for absences, and so documentation for excused absences will only be necessary in the case of extended absences.  You will need to go to Blackboard to enter your clicker ID number. Please ensure that you enter your name also so that you can earn credit for clicker usage."
