Most of the volume of the atom is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively charged electrons are dispersed.      There are many negatively charged electrons outside the nucleus as there are positively charged particles (named protons) within the nucleus, so that the atom is electrically neutral.      Protons (and Neutrons)  Audio 0:17:40.279234  Had bare proton (nucleus of hydrogen) Charge of alpha particle x 2 proton  Mass of alpha particle x 4 proton  So must be something else in the nucleus          Neutron      Chadwick’s Experiment (1932)  Audio 0:18:21.136318  The Atom’s Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:20:04.055851  All atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles:          Protons      Neutrons      Electrons        Protons and neutrons have nearly identical masses          The mass of the proton is 1.67262 * 10^-27 kg      The mass of the neutron is 1.67493 × 10^–27 kg.      The mass of the electron is 9.1 × 10^31 kg.        The charge of the proton and the charge of the electron are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. The neutron has no charge.Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:21:17.788117  Elements: Defined by Their Numbers of Protons  The most important number to the identity of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus.  The number of protons defines the element.  The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is itsatomic number and is given the symbol Z.Isotopes: Elements with Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:24:33.380011  All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; however, they do not necessarily have the same number of neutrons.          Example:                  All neon atoms contain 10 protons, but theymay contain 10, 11, or 12 neutrons.          All three types of neon atoms exist, and each has a slightly different mass.                                Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:26:45.772174  The sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is its mass number and is represented by the symbol A.    X is the chemical symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:28:13.708943  A second common notation for isotopes is the chemical symbol (or chemical name) followed by a dash and the mass number of the isotope.  Isotopes: Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:28:56.545513  The relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a given element is roughly constant.  The percentages are called the natural abundance of the isotopes.  Clicker Question  Audio 0:32:59.698445  What is the atomic number (Z), mass number (A), of chlorine with 18 neutrons?  Z = 17, A = 35 (or 17 + 18)Ions: Charged Atoms Losing and Gaining Electrons  Audio 0:34:19.624557  The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus (designated by its atomic number Z).  In chemical changes, however, atoms can lose or gain electrons and become charged particles called ions.          Positively charged ions are called cations.                  Metal elements, such as Na+, form cations.                    Negatively charged ions are called anions.                  Nonmetal elements, such as F–, form anions.                    Atomic Mass: The Average Mass of an Element’s Atoms  Audio 0:36:03.449187  Atomic mass is sometimes called the atomic weight or standard atomic weight.  The atomic mass of each element is directly beneath the element’s symbol in the periodic table.  The atomic mass of an element represents the average mass of the isotopes that compose that element          It is a weighted value based on the element’s natural abundance of each isotope.          Audio 0:36:29.805279  Mass Spectrometry: Measuring the Mass of Atoms and Molecules  The masses of atoms and the percent abundances of isotopes of elements are measured using mass spectrometry—a technique that separates particles according to their mass.  Atomic Mass: Problem  Naturally occurring chlorine consists of 75.77% chlorine-35 atoms (mass 34.97 amu) and 24.23% chlorine-37 atoms (mass 36.97 amu).  Calculate chlorine’s atomic mass.

Democritus wrote, “Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.”                  He proposed that atoms existed in different shapes and sizes and moved randomly through empty space.                      Plato and Aristotle did not embrace the atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          They held that matter had no smallest parts.      They proposed that different substances were composed of various proportions of fire, air, earth, and water.      Early Building Blocks of Matter Ideas  Audio 0:24:38.965354  An English chemist, John Dalton (1766–1844) offered convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          Dalton’s atomic theory of matter        Modern Atomic Theory and Its Laws:          Law of conservation of mass      Law of definite proportions      Law of multiple proportions      John Dalton and the Atomic Theory  John Dalton and the Atomic Theory          Each element is composed of tiny indestructible particles called atoms.      All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements      Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds      Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, atoms change only the way that they are bound together with other atoms.      The Law of Conservation of Mass  Audio 0:27:20.929720  Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conservation of mass, which states the following:          In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.        When a chemical reaction occurs, the total mass of the substances involved in the reaction does not change.          This law is consistent with the idea that matter is composed of small, indestructible particles.        Audio 0:28:53.424491  The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:29:25.280225  In 1797 a French chemist named Joseph Proust made observations on the composition of compounds  He summarized his observations in the law of definite proportions:          All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent elements.        The law of definite proportions is sometimes called the law of constant composition.An Example of the Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:02.047142  The decomposition of 18.0 g of water (H2O) results in 16.0 g of oxygen (O2) and 2.0 g of hydrogen (H2)  an oxygen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 8:1.  Problem Solving: The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:39.294000  Two samples of carbon dioxide decompose into their constituent elements. One produces 25.6 g oxygen and 9.60 g carbon, the other 21.6 g oxygen, and 8.10 g carbon. Show that these results are consistent with the law of definite proportions.The Law of Multiple Proportions  Audio 0:34:08.719405  In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions:          When two elements (call them A and B) form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine with 1 g of element A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.                  When an atom of A combines with either one, two, three, or more atoms of B, the following molecular compounds are possible: AB1, AB2, AB3, etc.                      Audio 0:36:00.257154  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are two compounds composed of the same two elements: carbon and oxygen.                The mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1; therefore, 2.67 g of oxygen reacts with 1 g of carbon.      In carbon monoxide, however, the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon is 1.33:1, or 1.33 g of oxygen to every 1 g of carbon.        The ratio of these two masses is itself a small whole number                Problem Solving: The Law of Multiple Proportions  Nitrogen forms a number of compounds with oxygen. Measurements of the masses of nitrogen and oxygen that form upon decomposing these compounds show that nitrogen dioxide contains 2.28 g oxygen to every 1.00 g of nitrogen, while dinitrogen monoxide contains 0.570 g oxygen to every 1.00 g nitrogen. Show that the results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions:                            4 is a small whole number which coincides with the law of multiple proportions                    The Structure of the AtomThe Discovery of the Electron  Audio 0:41:57.987686  From J. J. Thomson’s (1856–1940) cathode rays experiments, it was observed that          a beam of particles, called cathode rays, traveled from the negatively charged electrode (called the cathode) to the positively charged one (called the anode);      the particles that compose the cathode ray have the following properties:                  They travel in straight lines.          They are independent of the composition of the material from which they originate (the cathode).          They carry a negative electrical charge.                      J.J. Thomson was able to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles by deflecting them using electric and magnetic fields, as shown in the figure on the bottom of the next slide.          The value he measured was –1.76 × 103 coulombs per gram. © 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.

An element is a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.          Basic building blocks of matter      Composed of single type of atom, like helium        A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions.  Most elements are chemically reactive and combine with other elements to form compounds.Heterogeneous Mixture  A heterogeneous mixture is one in which the composition varies from one region of the mixture to another.          Made of multiple substances, whose presence can be seen (example: a salt and sand mixture)                  Portions of a sample of a heterogeneous mixture have different composition and properties.                    Homogeneous Mixture  A homogeneous mixture is one made of multiple substances, but it appears to be one substance.  All portions of a sample have the same composition and properties (like sweetened tea).  Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Audio 0:12:42.707245  The approach to scientific knowledge is empirical  It is based on observation and experimentation.  The scientific method is a process for understanding nature by observing nature and its behavior through experimentation.  Key characteristics of the scientific method          Observations      Formulation of hypotheses      Experimentation      Formulation of laws and theories      Observations  Observations:          They are also known as data.      They are the descriptions about the characteristics or behavior of nature.        Observations, verification of observations, and experimentation can lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Scientists try to understand the universe through empirical knowledge gained through observation and experimentGathering Empirical Knowledge ─ Observation  Some observations are descriptions of the characteristics or behavior of nature ─ qualitative  Some observations compare a characteristic to a standard numerical scale ─ quantitativeFrom Observation to Understanding  Audio 0:15:58.585935  Hypothesis – a tentative interpretation or explanation for an observation  A good hypothesis is one that can be tested to be proved wrong!Testing Ideas  Audio 0:17:57.155168  Ideas in science are tested with experiments  An experiment is a set of highly controlled procedures designed to test whether an idea about nature is valid  The experiment generates observations that will either validate or invalidate the ideaIs this a good hypothesis?  Audio 0:19:00.330922  Yesterday, the phase of the moon was a crescent. I observed that it rained a lot yesterday.  It also rained during the previous crescent moon.  I hypothesize that crescent moons cause rain showers          The hypothesis is the ‘why?’        My answer: This is a good hypothesis because it can be tested and proved wrong  Audio 0:21:04.453540  Best answer: C          It’s a good hypothesis because it’s falsifiable      Audio 0:23:23.754722      Audio 0:25:56.261455      Good reasons to understand the importance of hypothesis      From Specific to General Understanding  Audio 0:26:25.458523  A hypothesis is a potential explanation for a single or small number of observations  A scientific theory is a general explanation for why things in nature are the way they are and behave the way they do          Integrates a lot of different observations      Lets us predict what’s happening in the universe      Think about it  Given what you just learned about the term “Theory”, what’s wrong with this statement:          “The theory of gravity is just a theory and therefore probably wrong”                  Audio 0:27:55.076377          By the time you get to calling things theories, they have been tested a lot                          The scientific method says you can’t prove anything, you can only disprove things              You’ll have to explain exceptions to the theory at some point so a new theory will emerge                                          From Specific to General Observations  A scientific law is a statement that summarizes all past observations and predicts future observations          Law of Conservation of Mass – “In a chemical reaction matter is neither created nor destroyed.”        A scientific law allows you to predict future observations            Audio 0:31:28.593326      Relationships Between Pieces of the Scientific Method  The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  It is necessary to be careful with the information presented by an experimentalist who lacks theoretical principles… [he] gathers at random several facts and presents them as proofs… scientific knowledge without reasoning [theory] does not exist.”          J. le R. d’Alembert (1717-1783), from Nouvelles Experiences sur la Resistance des Fluids. Jombert, Paris (1997)        D’Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ….Unfortunately he carried [his]… pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong…          Thomas L. Hankins (1990). Jean D’Alembert: Science and the Enlightenment. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 236. ISBN 2881243991      Why Is Scientific Measurement Important?  Scientific data can be either qualifiable or quantifiable          Qualifiable data are observational                  Subjective in nature          Examples: color, shape                      Quantifiable data are measurable (empirical).

Although the atoms and molecules in a solidvibrate, they do not move around or pasteach other.  Consequently, a solid has a fixed volume andrigid shape.          Ice, aluminum, and diamond are good examplesof solids.      Liquid Matter  In liquid matter, atoms or molecules pack about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each other.  Liquids have fixed volume but not a fixed shape.  Liquids’ ability to flow makes them assume the shape of their container.          Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at room temperature.      Gaseous Matter  In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them.  They are free to move relative to one another.  Fill available space  These qualities make gases compressible.Classification of Matter by Components  Matter can be classified according to its composition: elements, compounds, and mixtures.  a pure substance is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant  a mixture is a substance composed of two or more components in proportions that can vary from one sample to another  Vocab            Term      Definition                  matter      anything that has mass and occupies space (e.g. has volume)              atoms      Basic submicroscopic particles that constitute the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter              molecules      Substances formed when two or more atoms come together (bond) in specific geometric arrangements              chemistry      a discipline that seeks to understand matter and its properties, and the transformations that matter undergoes- particularly between molecules              state      physical form of matter based on what properties it exhibits (i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.

A survey of the fundamental facts, principles, and theories of general chemistry. Usually offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.Student Learning OutcomesThe objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles that form the foundations of chemistry.  An understanding of the quantum mechanical model of atoms provides the basis for understanding atomic structure, which in turn predicts the physical and chemical properties of atoms, as illustrated in the periodic table of the elements.  This understanding provides the basis for understanding the nature of chemical bonds: ionic and covalent.  An understanding of chemical bonds in turn provides the basis for predicting the structures of molecules, and a qualitative understanding of chemical reactions.  A quantitative understanding of the energy of atoms and molecules will provide the basis for predicting the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions and the accompanying release or absorption of heat.  The last objective is to be able to quantitatively predict the properties of gases and understand how the speed of molecular motion relates to the chemical and physical properties of gases and gas mixtures.Required Texts  TURNING TECH / NXT CLICKER (Required)  TRO (CUSTOM) / Chemistry: Structure and Properties Package for University of Alabama, 1/e (Required)Exams and AssignmentsExams 1 – 3 will be given on Wednesday September 7th, October 5th and November 9th from 6:30 - 7:50 PM 127 BiologyFinal Exam:  Monday.
