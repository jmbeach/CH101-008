The pressures here could also be partial pressures.  The general conceptual plan for these kinds of calculations is as follows:  Practice Problem: Gases in Chemical Reactions  Carbon monoxide reacts with hydrogen to give methanol (CH3OH(g)). What volume (in liters) of H2 gas @ T=82 oC and P=738 Torr do we need to make 35.7 g methanol?Practice Problem: Using Molar Volume in Gas Stoichiometric Calculations  Audio 0:13:33.554013  How many grams of water form when 1.24 L of H2 gas at STP reacts completely with O2?Properties of (Ideal) Gases  Audio 0:16:46.617743  Expand to completely fill their container  Take the shape of their container  Low density– Much less dense than solid or liquid state  Compressible  Mixtures of gases are always homogeneous fluidsReal Gases  Real gases often do not behave like ideal gases at high pressure or low temperature.  Ideal gas laws assume                            no attractions between gas molecules; and                                      that gas molecules do not take up space.                          Based on the kinetic molecular theory                                            At low temperatures and high pressures, these assumptions are not valid.  Real Gas Behavior  Audio 0:19:58.672978    Because real molecules take up space, the molar volume of a real gas is larger than predicted by the ideal gas law at high pressures.The Effect of the Finite Volume of Gas Particles  Audio 0:21:34.753481  At low pressures, the molar volume of argon is nearly identical to that of an ideal gas.  But as the pressure increases, the molar volume of argon becomes greater than that of an ideal gas.– At the higher pressures, the argon atoms themselves occupy a significant portion of the gas volume, making the actual volume greater than that predicted by the ideal gas law.Modification of the Ideal Gas Equation  Audio 0:22:23.986334  In 1873, Johannes van der Waals (1837–1923) modified the ideal gas equation to fit the behavior of real gases at high pressure.  The molecular volume makes the real volume larger than the ideal gas law would predict.  Van der Waals modified the ideal gas equation to account for the molecular volume.– b is a constant van der Waals determined and is different for every gas because the molecules of each gas are of different sizes.                The Effect of Intermolecular Attractions  Audio 0:23:43.041877  Van der Waals modified the ideal gas equation to account for the intermolecular attractions.– a is another constant that van der Waals determined and is different for every gas because the molecules of each gas have different strengths of attraction.                The Effect of Intermolecular Attractions  At high temperature, the pressure of gases is nearly identical to that of an ideal gas.  But at lower temperatures, the pressure of gases is less than that of an ideal gas.– At the lower temperatures, the gas atoms spend more time interacting with each other and less time colliding with the walls, making the actual pressure less than that predicted by the ideal gas law.The Effect of Intermolecular Attractions  Audio 0:24:58.494772  Van der Waals Equation  Audio 0:25:16.451107  Combining the equations to account for molecular volume and intermolecular attractions, the following equation for real gases is derived:  Real Gases  A plot of PV/RT versus P for 1 mole of a gas shows the difference between real and ideal gases.PV/RT Plots: Real versus Ideal  Audio 0:26:19.981110  Real Gases  Audio 0:27:22.870965  A plot of PV/RT versus P for 1 mole of a gas shows the difference between real and ideal gases.

What is the identity of the halogen? Br:79.90Answer: C Daltonʼs Law of Partial Pressures  Audio 0:12:15.535453  For a multicomponent gas mixture, we calculate the partial pressure of each component from the ideal gas law and the number of moles of that component (nn) as follows:                  The sum of the partial pressures of the components in a gas mixture equals the total pressure:                Daltonʼs Law of Partial Pressures  This relationship is known as Daltonʼs law of partial pressures.  Mole Fraction: χa  Audio 0:13:15.434990  The number of moles of a component in a mixture divided by the total number of moles in the mixture is the mole fraction.                  The ratio of the partial pressure a single gas contributes and total pressure is equal to the mole fraction.                Mole Fraction  Audio 0:14:01.065205  For gases, the mole fraction of a component is equivalent to its percent by volume divided by 100%.– Nitrogen has a 78% composition of air. Find its partial pressure.                Practice Problem: Total Pressure and Partial Pressures  Audio 0:14:37.896502  A 1.00 L mixture of helium, neon, and argon has a total pressure of 662 mmHg at 298 K. If the partial pressure of He is 341 mmHg and that of Ne is 112 mmHg, what mass of Ar is present?Deep-Sea Diving, the Bends, and Partial Pressures  Audio 0:18:06.803368  Deep-Sea Diving and Partial Pressures  Audio 0:22:33.181580    When a diver breathes compressed air, the abnormally high partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs leads to an elevated concentration of oxygen in body tissues.Collecting Gases  Audio 0:22:51.487861  Gases are often collected by having them displace water from a container.– The problem is that because water evaporates, there is also water vapor in the collected gas.  The partial pressure of the water vapor, called the vapor pressure, depends only on the temperature.– A table can be used to find the partial pressure of the water vapor when collecting a gas over water.– Example:          A gas sample is collected over water. The gas sample has a total pressure of 758.2 mmHg at 25 °C.      From a vapor pressure of water table, the partial pressure of the water vapor is 23.78 mmHg at 25 oC.      The partial pressure of the dry gas will be 734.4 mmHg.        Vapor Pressure of Water  Kinetic Molecular Theory  Audio 0:25:29.060382  The simplest model for the behavior of gases is the kinetic molecular theory.  In this theory, a gas is modeled as a collection of particles (either molecules or atoms, depending on the gas) in constant motion.  Kinetic Molecular Theory Postulates  The particles of the gas (either atoms or molecules) are constantly moving.  The attraction between particles are neglected.  When the moving gas particles hit another gas particle or the container, they do not stick; they bounce off and continue moving in another direction.  There is a lot of empty space between the gas particles compared to the size of the particles.Kinetic Molecular Theory  Kinetic Molecular Theory  The collision of one particle with another (or with the walls of its container) is completely elastic.– This means that when two particles collide, they may exchange energy, but there is no overall loss of energy.          Any kinetic energy lost by one particle is completely gained by the other.        The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature.– As you raise the temperature of the gas, the average speed of the particles increases.          But not all the gas particles are moving at the same speed!      The Nature of Pressure  Because the gas particles are constantly moving, they strike the sides of the container with a force.  The result of many particles in a gas sample exerting forces on the surfaces around them is a constant pressure.          Pressure (P) = Force (F)/Area (A)      Gas Laws Explain Boyleʼs Law  Boyleʼs law says that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure.– Decreasing the volume forces the molecules into a smaller space.  More molecules will collide with the container at any one instant, increasing the pressure.Gas Laws Explain Charlesʼs Law  Charlesʼs law says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.– According to kinetic molecular theory, when we increase the temperature of a gas, the average speed—and thus the average kinetic energy—of the particles increases.  The greater volume spreads the collisions out over a greater surface area, so that the pressure is unchanged.Gas Laws Explain Avogadroʼs Law  Audio 0:27:49.912122  Avogadroʼs law says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules.  Increasing the number of gas molecules causes more of them to hit the wall at the same time.  To keep the pressure constant, the volume must then increase.Gas Laws Explain Daltonʼs Law  Audio 0:28:02.848774  Daltonʼs law says that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures.  According to kinetic molecular theory, the particles have negligible size and they do not interact.– Particles of different masses have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature.  Because the average kinetic energy is the same, the total pressure of the collisions is the same.Temperature and Molecular Velocities  Molecular Speed versus Molar Mass  Audio 0:33:13.886790• To have the same average kinetic energy, heavier molecules must have a slower average speed.  Temperature versus Molecular Speed  Audio 0:33:55.441736• As the temperature of a gas sample increases, the velocity distribution of the molecules shifts toward higher velocity.– The distribution function “spreads out,” resulting in more molecules with faster speeds.  Mean Free Path  Audio 0:34:47.342762  Molecules in a gas travel in straight lines until they collide with another molecule or the container.  The average distance a molecule travels between collisions is called the mean free path.  Mean free path decreases as the pressure increases.  Diffusion  Audio 0:35:31.009397  The process of a collection of molecules spreading out from high concentration to low concentration is called diffusion.                Diffusion and Effusion  Audio 0:36:50.045677  The process by which a collection of molecules escapes through a small hole into a vacuum is called effusion.  The rates of diffusion and effusion of a gas are both related to the root mean square (rms) velocity of the gas particles.  For gases at the same temperature, this means that the rate of gas movement is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.  Grahamʼs Law of Effusion  The ratio of the rates of effusion of two different gases at the same temperature is given by the following equation:  Clicker 3  Audio 0:39:33.577535  The rate of effusion of oxygenVocab            Term      Definition                  mole fraction      number of moles of a component in a mixture divided by the total number of moles in the mixture              vapor pressure      partial pressure of water vapor              kinetic molecular theory      model of gas behavior in which gas is modeled as a collection of particles (simplest model)              mean free path      average distance a molecule travels between collisions              diffusion      process of a collection of molecules spreading out from high concentration to low concentration              effusion      process by which a collection of molecules escapes through a small hole into a vacuum"

V = constant × n (moles)  V/n = constant  (V1/n1) = (V2/n2)  The volume of a gas sample increases linearly with the number of moles of gas in the sample.

Standard pressure = 1 atm  Standard temperature = 273 K = 0 °C  Standard amount = 1 mol  Standard volume = 22.4 L– The volume occupied by one mole of a substance is its molar volume at STP (T = 273 K or 0 °C and P = 1atm).  Molar Volume at STP  Audio 0:28:15.214651  The volume of one mole of gas at STP is called the molar volume.          6.022 × 1023 molecules of gas– Note that the type of gas is immaterial.        It is important to recognize that one-mole measures of different gases have different masses, even though they have the same volume.Density of a Gas  Audio 0:29:06.988437  Density is the ratio of mass to volume.– Density = (mass/volume)  Density of a gas is generally given in grams/liter (g/L).  The mass of 1 mol = molar mass.  The volume of 1 mol at STP = 22.4 L.          Density (d) = [mass of gas (g/mol)]/[volume (L)]                  Density (g/L) = (molar mass)/(molar volume)                    Density of a Gas at STP  Audio 0:29:33.594188  For example, the densities of helium and nitrogen gas at STP are as follows:                Molar Mass of a Gas  Audio 0:30:27.999878  One of the methods chemists use to determine the molar mass of an unknown substance is to heat a weighed sample until it becomes a gas; measure the temperature, pressure, and volume; and use the ideal gas law.

Its volume is 0.225 L at 55 oC and pressure of 886 mmHg. What is the molar mass?        Mixtures of Gases and Partial Pressures  Many gas samples are not pure but are mixtures of gases.  Dry air, for example, is a mixture containing nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and a few other gases in trace amounts.  Therefore, in certain applications, the mixture can be thought of as one gas.– By knowing air’s pressure, volume, and temperature, the total moles of molecules in an air sample can be determined—even though they are different compounds.                Partial Pressure: Pgas  Audio 0:38:48.952989  The pressure of a single gas in a mixture of gases is called its partial pressure.  The partial pressure of a gas can be calculated if– a fraction of the mixture it composes and the total pressure are known; or– the number of moles of the gas in a container of a given volume and temperature are known.  The sum of the partial pressures of all the gases in the mixture equals the total pressure. This is known as Daltonʼs law of partial pressures.

(Fe: 55.85)Fe2O3(s)+2Al(s)-&gt;Al2O3(s)+2Fe(s) delta H rxn = -852kJ    A) 1.52*10^3 kJ  B) 3.02*10^3 kJ  C) 8.40*10^3 kJ  D) 964 kJ  E) 482 kJAnswer: A Gas Pressure  Audio 0:07:39.758980  Gas pressure is a result of the constant movement of the gas molecules and their collisions with the surfaces around them.  The pressure of a gas depends on several factors:          Number of gas particles in a given volume      Volume of the container      Average speed of the gas particles      Mass of the gas particles      Gas Pressure  The total pressure exerted by a gas depends on frequency of collisions &amp; momentum change during a collision:  Number of gas particles in a given volume          The fewer the gas particles, the lower the force per unit area and the lower the pressure.                  A low density of gas particles results in low pressure. A high density of gas particles results in high pressure.          As volume increases, concentration of gas molecules decreases (number of molecules does not change, but since the volume increases, the concentration goes down).                          This, in turn, results in fewer molecular collisions, which results in lower pressure.                                            Momentum of individual molecules          speed and mass of molecules                  Temperature                      Atmospheric Pressure Effects  Audio 0:10:36.762960  Variation in pressure in Earthʼ s atmosphere creates wind, and changes in pressure help us to predict weather.          The H in this map indicates regions of high pressure, usually associated with clear weather.      The L indicates regions of low pressure, usually associated with unstable weather.        The number of gas particles in a given volume decreases with increasing altitude.          Hence, pressure decreases with increasing altitude.        Pressure Imbalance in the Ear  Audio 0:11:41.834490  If there is a difference in pressure across the eardrum membrane, the membrane will be pushed out.          The result is what we commonly call a “popped eardrum.”        Pressure Units  Audio 0:13:12.088425  Common units of pressure:          Millimeter of mercury (Hg)        mmHg          Torr        Same as millimeter of mercury          Atmosphere (atm)        Conversion between pressure units:          1 mmHg = 1 torr      760 mmHg = 1 atm      760 torr = 1 atm        A Table of Pressure Units  Audio 0:17:58.486884  The Manometer  Audio 0:18:10.818952  The pressure of a gas trapped in a container can be measured with an instrument called a manometer.  Manometers are U-shaped tubes partially filled with a liquid that are connected to the gas sample on one side and open to the air on the other.  A competition is established between the pressures of the atmosphere and the gas.          The difference in the liquid levels is a measure of the difference in pressure between the gas and the atmosphere.        For this sample, the gas pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure; the mercury level on the left side of the tube is higher than the level on the right.  Basic Properties of Gases  Audio 0:20:54.286850  There are four basic properties of a gas:          Pressure (P)                  Units in atmosphere (atm)                    Volume (V)                  Units in liters (L)                    Temperature (T)                  Units in Kelvin (K)                          Where Kelvin (K) = Celsius T + 273                                          Amount in moles (n)        These properties are interrelated.          When one changes, it affects the others.                  The simple gas laws describe the relationships between pairs of these properties.                    The Simple Gas Laws  Audio 0:23:11.105305  The simple gas laws are as follows:          Boyleʼs Law        Investigates pressure and volume relationship          Charlesʼs Law        Investigates volume and temperature relationship          Avogadroʼs Law        Investigates volume and amount (mole) relationshipBoyleʼs Law: Volume and Pressure  Audio 0:25:25.284216  Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and Robert Hooke used a J-tube to measure the volume of a sample of gas at different pressures.  They trapped a sample of air in the J-tube and added mercury to increase the pressure on the gas.          They observed an inverse relationship between volume and pressure.        Hence, an increase in one causes a decrease in the other.  Inverse Relationship As the volume of a gas sample is decreased, gas molecules collide with surrounding surfaces more frequently, resulting in greater pressure. A plot of the volume of a gas versus pressure. The plot shows that volume and pressure are inversely related.  Pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume when temperature and the amount of gas are held constant.          As P increases, V decreases by the same factor.      P × V = constant        Graphing Boyle’s Law          A graph of P versus V results in a curve.      A graph of P versus 1/V results in a straight line plot.        Relationship:          P1 × V1 = P2 × V2      Boyleʼs Law and Diving  Audio 0:26:17.106941  For every 10 m of depth, a diver experiences approximately one additional atmosphere of pressure due to the weight of the surrounding water.          At 20 m, for example, the diver experiences approximately 3 atm of pressure.        If a diver holds his or her breath and rises to the surface quickly, the outside pressure drops to 1 atm.          According to Boyleʼs law, what should happen to the volume of air in the lungs?        Because the pressure is decreasing by a factor of 3, the volume will expand by a factor of 3, causing damage to internal organs.  Always exhale when rising!Clicker 2  What volume (in mL) will a sample of F2 gas occupy in a syringe at 5.5 atm, if the F2 has a volume of 25.0 mL at 1.2 atm?          A) 11 mL      B) 17 mL      C) 3.8 mL      D) 5.5 mL      E) 7.6 mL      Answer: DCharlesʼs Law: Volume and Temperature Have a Direct Relationship  Audio 0:32:43.927172  The volume of a fixed amount of gas at a constant pressure increases linearly with increasing temperature in kelvins.          Volume and temperature have a direct relationship        if the volume of a gas increases with increasing temperature.  V = constant × T (T measured in kelvins)  V/T = constant  (V1/T1) = (V2/T2)Charlesʼs Law: Graphically  Audio 0:34:58.249430  The extrapolated lines cannot be measured experimentally because all gases condense into liquids before –273.15 °C is reached.  If the lines are extrapolated back to a volume of 0, they all show the same temperature, −273.15 °C = 0 K, called absolute zero.  Charlesʼs Law: A Molecular View  When the temperature of a gas sample increases, the gas particles move faster.          Collisions with the walls are more frequent.      The force exerted with each collision is greater.        The only way for the pressure (the force per unit area) to remain constant is for the gas to occupy a larger volume so that collisions become less frequent and occur over a larger area.

This structure is called a crystal lattice.  The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.  The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between cations and anions, leading to the most stable arrangement.Lattice Energy  The extra stability that accompanies the formation of the crystal lattice is measured as the lattice energy.  The lattice energy is the energy released when the solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.          Always exothermic      Hard to measure directly, but can be calculated from knowledge of other processes        Lattice energy depends directly on the size of charges and inversely on distance between ions.Determining Lattice Energy: The Born–Haber Cycle  The Born–Haber cycle is a hypothetical series of reactions that represents the formation of an ionic compound from its constituent elements.  The reactions are chosen so that the change in enthalpy of each reaction is known except for the last one, which is the lattice energy.Born–Haber Cycle and Hess’s Law    Use Hess’s law to add up enthalpy changes of other reactions to determine the lattice energy.  Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Size  Audio 0:31:13.639819  The force of attraction between charged particles is inversely proportional to the distance between them.  Larger ions mean the center of positive charge (nucleus of the cation) is farther away from the negative charge (electrons of the anion).          Larger ion = weaker attraction      Weaker attraction = smaller lattice energy      Lattice Energy versus Ion Size  Audio 0:31:57.501608  The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges.  Larger charge means the ions are more strongly attracted.          Larger charge = stronger attraction      Stronger attraction = larger lattice energy            Trends in Lattice Energy: Ion Charge  The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges.  Larger charge means the ions are more strongly attracted.          Larger charge = stronger attraction      Stronger attraction = larger lattice energy        Of the two factors, ion charge is generally more important.

If the reaction is changed (e.g., reversed, doubled), the ΔH reflects those changes.                  Enthalpy is an extensive physical thermal property.                      Example:          When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ΔHrxn is multiplied by that factor because ΔHrxn is extensive.

The ΔHreaction can be estimated by comparing the cost of breaking old bonds to the income from making new bonds.

In the gas state      Homolytically—each atom gets ½ bonding electrons      Determining Enthalpies from Bond Energies  The actual bond energy depends on the surrounding atoms and other factors.

In practice, it is easiest to do a process in such a way that there is no change in volume, so w = 0.          At constant volume, ΔEsystem = qsystem.        In practice, temperature changes of individual chemicals involved in the reaction cannot be observed directly, so instead the temperature change in the surroundings is measured.          Using an insulated container (e.g., controlled surroundings)      qsystem = −qsurroundings        The surrounding area is called a bomb calorimeter and is usually made of a sealed, insulated container filled with water.          qsurroundings = qcalorimeter = –qsystem      Bomb Calorimeter    It is used to measure ΔE because it is a constant volume system.  The heat capacity of the calorimeter is the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter for each degree rise in temperature and is called the calorimeter constant.          Ccal, kJ/°C      Practice Problem: Measuring ΔErxn in a Bomb Calorimeter  When 1.010 g of sucrose (C12H22O11) undergoes combustion in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature rises from 24.92 oC to 28.33 oC.

H is a state function.                  H = E + PV                      The enthalpy change, ΔH, of a reaction is the heat evolved in a reaction at constant pressure.          ΔHreaction = qreaction at constant pressure        Usually ΔH and ΔE are similar in value; the difference is largest for reactions that produce or use large quantities of gas.Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions  When ΔH is negative, heat is being released by the system into the surroundings.          The surroundings will “feel” hot.      Temperature of the surroundings increased from the energy released by the system.      This is called an exothermic reaction.        When ΔH is positive, heat is being absorbed by the system from the surroundings.          The surroundings will “feel” cold.        Temperature of the surroundings decreased because energy left the surroundings to flow into the system.  This is called an endothermic reaction.Particulate View of Exothermic Reactions  For an exothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature rises due to a release of thermal energy by the reaction.  This extra thermal energy comes from the conversion of some of the chemical potential energy in the reactants into kinetic energy in the form of heat.  During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken and new bonds are made.  The products of the reaction have less chemical potential energy than the reactants.  The difference in energy is released as heat.Particulate View of Endothermic Reactions  In an endothermic reaction, the surrounding’s temperature drops due to absorption of some of its thermal energy by the reaction.  During the course of a reaction, existing bonds are broken and new bonds are made.  The products of the reaction have more chemical potential energy than the reactants.  To acquire this extra energy, some of the thermal energy of the surroundings is converted into chemical potential energy stored in the products.Enthalpy of Chemical Reaction  The enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is an extensive property.          The more reactants you use, the larger the enthalpy change.        By convention, we calculate the enthalpy change for the number of moles of reactants in the reaction as written. C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) → 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ΔH = −2044 kJ 1 mol C3H8(g) = –2044 kJ or 5 mol O2(g) = –2044 kJPractice Problem: Enthalpy Stoichiometry  Calculate the heat (in kJ) associated with the complete combustion of all of the propane in a 13.2 kg propane tank: C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) è 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) ΔHrxn= -2044 kJ        Measuring ΔH: Calorimetry at Constant Pressure  Reactions done in aqueous solution are at constant pressure.  The calorimeter is often nested foam cups containing the solution.          qreaction = –qsolution = –(masssolution × Cs, solution × ΔT)        ΔHreaction = qconstant pressure = qreaction          To get ΔHreaction per mol, divide by the number of moles.

Think of energy as a quantity an object or collection of objects can possess      Energy can be exchanged between objects through contact.      For example:                  through collisions                      Work is a force acting over a distance.          Energy = work = force × distance        Heat is the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature.  Think of heat and work as the two different ways that an object can exchange energy with other objects.          Either out of it, or into it      Classification of Energy  Audio 0:06:25.636622  Kinetic energy is energy of motion or energy that is being transferred.  Thermal energy is the energy associated with temperature.          Thermal energy is a form of kinetic energy.            Classification of Energy  Audio 0:08:21.249403  Potential energy is energy that is stored in an object or energy associated with the composition and position of the object.          Audio 0:09:49.310141      Energy stored in the structure of a compound is potential energy.            Manifestations of Energy  Audio 0:12:15.834511  Some Forms of Energy  Audio 0:13:00.066117  Heat or thermal energy          Kinetic energy associated with molecular motion        Electrical          Kinetic energy associated with the flow of electrical charge        Light or radiant energy          Kinetic energy associated with energy transitions in an atom        Nuclear          Potential energy in the nucleus of atoms        Chemical          Potential energy due to the structure of the atoms, the attachment between atoms, the atoms’ positions relative to each other in a molecule, or the molecules’ relative positions in the structure      Units of Energy  Audio 0:14:08.320504  The amount of kinetic energy an object has is directly proportional to its mass and velocity.          KE = ½mv2        When the mass is in kg and velocity is in m/s, the unit for kinetic energy is a joule (J).          1 J = kg m2/s2 = 1 N m      1 joule of energy is the amount of energy needed to move a 1 kg mass at a speed of 1 m/s.        A calorie (cal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 °C.          1 kcal = energy needed to raise 1000 g of water 1 °C        A food Calorie (Cal) is 1000 calories.          1 kcal is equivalent to ONE food Calorie = kcals.      Conversion between Energy Units  Conservation of Energy  Audio 0:18:02.274506  The law of conservation of energy states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.  When energy is transferred between objects, or converted from one form to another, the total amount of energy present at the beginning must be present at the end.  System and Surroundings  System is defined as the material within which the process we are studying happens.  Surroundings are defined as everything else with which the system can exchange energy.  Thermodynamics is the study of energy that is exchanged between the system and the surroundings.          Energy can flow from the system to the surroundings.                  Energy of the system drops; energy of surroundings increases.          Exothermic (flow out of system)                    Energy can flow into the system from the surroundings.                  Energy of the system increases; energy of the surroundings decreases.          Endothermic (flow into system)                    Comparing the Amount of Energy in the System and Surroundings during Transfer  Audio 0:24:03.313606  Conservation of energy means that the amount of energy gained or lost by the system has to be equal to the amount of energy lost or gained by the surroundings.  The First Law of Thermodynamics: Law of Conservation of Energy  Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its interconversions.  Audio 0:24:58.285011  The first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy.          This means that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant.      Therefore, you can never build a system that will continue to produce energy without some source of energy.      Energy Flow and Conservation of Energy  Audio 0:26:06.301332  Conservation of energy requires that the sum of the energy changes in the system and the surroundings must be zero.  Change(energyuniverse) = 0          =Change(Energysystem) + Change(Energysurroundings)      ΔEnergyuniverse = 0 = ΔEnergysystem + ΔEnergysurroundings      Δ is the symbol that is used to mean change.                  – Final amount – initial amount                    Internal Energy  Audio 0:27:47.890733  The internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all of the particles that compose the system.  The change in the internal energy of a system only depends on the amount of energy in the system at thebeginning and end.          ΔE = Efinal – Einitial      ΔEreaction = Eproducts − Ereactants        A state function is a mathematical function whose result only depends on the initial and final conditions, not on the process used.  It is an Extensive Property –depends upon the amount of materialState Function  To reach the top of the mountain, there are two trails:                            Long and winding                                      Short but steep                      Regardless of the trail, when you reach the top, you will be 10,000 ft above the base.  The distance from the base to the peak of the mountain is a state function. It depends only on the difference in elevation between the base and the peak, not on how you arrive there!  In Summary:  Audio 0:33:20.823776  If the reactants have a higher internal energy than the products:          ΔEsys is said to be negative because energy flows OUT of the system into the surroundings.        If the reactants have a lower internal energy than the products:          ΔEsys is said to be positive because energy flows INTO the system from the surroundings.        The internal energy of the system can be thought in a similar manner.          Energy flowing out of the system is like a withdrawal and therefore carries a negative sign.      Energy flowing into the system is like a deposit and carries a positive sign.      Energy Exchange  Audio 0:34:35.272796  Energy is exchanged between the system and surroundings through heat and work.          q = heat (thermal) energy      w = work energy      q and w are NOT state functions; their value depends on the process.                  ΔE = q + w                              Energy Exchange  Audio 0:35:29.581181  Chemists are “System Oriented” so energy gained by system is positive, energy lost is negative  doesn’t matter if it is heat flow or work  (Older) engineering convention where heat flow in is positive and work out is positive  Heat Exchange  Audio 0:36:39.238039  Heat is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and surroundings.  Heat exchange occurs when system and surroundings have a difference in temperature.  Temperature is the measure of the thermal energy within a sample of matter.  Heat flows from matter with high temperature to matter with low temperature until both objects reach the same temperature.          Thermal equilibrium      Quantity of Heat Energy Absorbed: Heat Capacity  Audio 0:38:11.929773  When a system absorbs heat, its temperature increases.  The increase in temperature is directly proportional tothe amount of heat absorbed.  The proportionality constant is called the heat capacity, C.          q = C × ΔT      Units of C are J/°C or J/K.        The larger the heat capacity of the object being studied, the smaller the temperature rise will be for a given amount of heat.Factors Affecting Heat Capacity  The heat capacity of an object depends on its amount of matter.          Directly proportional to mass.      200 g of water requires twice as much heat to raise its temperature by 1 °C as does 100 g of water.        The heat capacity of an object depends on the type of material.          1000 J of heat energy will raise the temperature of 100 g of sand 12 °C, but only raise the temperature of 100 g of water by 2.4 °C.      Clicker 2  Which of the following signs on q and w represent a system that is doing work on the surroundings, as well as gaining heat from the surroundings?          A) q=+, w=-      B) q = -, w = +      C) q = +, w = +      D) q = -, w = -      E) None of these represent the system referenced      AVocab            Term      Definition                  energy      anything that has the capacity to do work              work      force acting over a distance              kinetic energy      energy of motion              thermal energy      energy associated with temperature              potential energy      energy stored in an object or associated with the composition of an object              heat      the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature              joule      the unit for kinetic energy (N m)              calorie      the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 °C              law of conservation of energy      states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed              system      the material within which the process we are studying happens              surroundings      defined as everything other than the system with which the system can exchange energy              thermodynamics      the study of energy and its interconversions              internal energy      the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all of the particles that compose the system              state function      mathematical function whose result only depends on the initial and final conditions, not on the process used              temperature      the measure of the thermal energy within a sample of matter"

Examples:      2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g) (combustion)      2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)      4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) (rusting)      Oxidation and Reduction (Redox)  Audio 0:11:42.911701  To convert a free element into an ion, the atoms must gain or lose electrons.          NOTE: If one atom loses electrons, another must accept them.        Atoms that lose electrons are being oxidized.          The reaction is referred to as oxidation.        Atoms that gain electrons are being reduced.          The reaction is referred to as reduction.        Audio 0:14:01.108735  Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)          Audio 0:14:42.939831      Na → Na+ + 1 e– (oxidation; sodium lost electrons)      Cl2 + 2 e– → 2 Cl– (reduction; chlorine atom gained electrons)      Redox Reactions  Audio 0:15:20.876721  Oxidation and reduction must occur simultaneously.          If an atom loses electrons, another atom must take them.        The reactant that reduces an element in another reactant is called the reducing agent.          The reducing agent contains the element that is oxidized.        The reactant that oxidizes an element in another reactant is called the oxidizing agent.          The oxidizing agent contains the element that is reduced.        Example: 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)          Na is oxidized, while Cl is reduced.      Na is the reducing agent, and Cl2 is the oxidizing agent.      Oxidation States: “Electron Book Keeping”  Audio 0:19:09.006032  For reactions that are not metal + nonmetal, or do not involve O2, a method for determining how the electrons are transferred is required to determine which element is being oxidized and which element is being reduced.  Chemists assign a number to each element in a reaction called an oxidation state that allows them to determine the electron flow in the reaction.          Audio 0:20:40.459510      Even though they look like them, oxidation states are not ion charges!                  Oxidation states are imaginary charges assigned based on a set of rules.          Ion charges are real, measurable charges.                    Rules for Assigning Oxidation States  Audio 0:23:41.166326  The following rules are in order of priority:          Free elements have an oxidation state = 0.                  Na = 0 and Cl2 = 0 in 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g)                    Monatomic ions have an oxidation state equal to their charge.                  Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl                    (a) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound is 0.                  Na = +1 and Cl = −1 in NaCl, (+1) + (−1) = 0                    Rules for Assigning Oxidation States Continued  Audio 0:25:29.324643          (b) The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a polyatomic ion equals the charge on the ion.                  N = +5 and O = −2 in NO3 –, (+5) + 3(−2) = −1                    (a) Group I metals have an oxidation state of +1 in all their compounds.                  Na = +1 in NaCl                    (b) Group II metals have an oxidation state of +2 in all their compounds.                  Mg = +2 in MgCl2                    In their compounds, nonmetals have oxidation states according to the following table.                  Nonmetals higher on the table take priority.

Carbon loses electrons and is oxidized.                    Sulfur changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of –2.                  Sulfur gains electrons and is reduced.                    Redox Reaction  Audio 0:37:34.617890  NOTE:  The transfer of electrons does not need to be a complete transfer (asoccurs in the formation of an ionic compound) for the reaction toqualify as oxidation–reduction.          For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas:                  H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)                      When hydrogen bonds to chlorine, the electrons are unevenly shared, resulting in:          An increase of electron density (reduction) for chlorine      A decrease in electron density (oxidation) for hydrogen      Combustion as Redox  2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)  Hydrogen and Oxygen reacts to form water in the gaseous state (steam).

Example:                  NO3 − is the nitrate ion, so it would become nitric.                                If a polyatomic ion name ends in          –ite, then change the ending to a      –ous suffix.      Example:                  SO3 2− is the sulfite ion, so it would become sulfurous.

An acid–base reaction is also called a neutralization reaction.        In acid–base reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.Acid–Base Reactions  Audio 0:13:19.839427  When an acid and base react, the reaction is called a neutralization reaction.          Example:                  2 HNO3(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) → Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2 H2O(l)                      As long as the salt that forms is soluble in water, the net ionic equation for an acid–base reaction is:          H+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)        A neutralization reaction is completed when the moles of acid equal the moles of base in the solution.          Moles of acid = Moles of base        A neutralization reaction does not always mean that the pH of the solution is 7.Acids and Bases in Solution  Audio 0:16:36.637260  Acids ionize in water to form H+ ions; more precisely, the H from the acid molecule is donated to a water molecule to form hydronium ion, H3O+.  Most chemists use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably.  Bases dissociate in water to form OH– ions.          Bases, such as NH3, that do not contain OH– ions produce OH– by pulling H off water molecules.        In the reaction of an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid combines with the OH– from the base to make water.– The cation from the base combines with the anion from the acid to make the salt.  Acid–Base Reaction  HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)  The reaction of hydrochloric acid (acid) and sodium hydroxide (base) forms sodium chloride (soluble salt) and water.

BAcid–Base Titrations  Audio 0:21:37.385327  This is a problem because some things can not be legally put down the sink and it depends on the acidity  In a titration, a substance in a solution of known concentration is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration.  When exactly enough solution has been added the reactants are in their stoichiometric ratio. Called the equivalence point          The solution of known concentration is added slowly from an instrument called a burette.                  A long glass tube with precise volume markings that allows small additions of solution                      The titrant is the solution in the burette.  Acid–Base Titrations  Audio 0:25:27.198386  In acid–base titrations, because both the reactant and product solutions are colorless, a chemical is added that changes color when the solution undergoes large changes in acidity/alkalinity.          The chemical is called an indicator.        The endpoint of a reaction is when the indicator color changes.  The endpoint of an acid–base titration is where the number of moles of H+ equals the number of moles of OH–.          This is known as the equivalence point.      Acid–Base Titration  Audio 0:26:39.290296  Titration    In this titration, NaOH is added to a dilute HCl solution. When the NaOH and HCl reach stoichiometric proportions (the equivalence point), the indicator changes color to pink.Practice Problem: Acid–Base Titration  Audio 0:32:01.268341  The titration of a 10.00 mL sample of HCL solution of unknown concentration requires 12.54 ml of a 0.100 M NaOH solution to reach the equivalence point.

In both acid–base and gas-evolution reactions, as in precipitation reactions, the reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other.          Many gas-evolution reactions are also acid– base reactions.      Example of Gas-Evolution Reactions  Audio 0:42:31.119388  Some reactions form a gas directly from the ion exchange.          K2S(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + H2S(g)        Other reactions form a gas by the decomposition of one of the ion exchange products into a gas and water.

Salt water is a homogeneous mixture of NaCl and H2O.      Sugar water is a homogeneous mixture of C12H22O11 and H2O.        How do solids such as salt and sugar dissolve in water?          Likes dissolve likes.      If your solute has roughly similar properties to your solvent, it will dissolve      What Happens When a Solute Dissolves?  Audio 0:23:19.196102  There are attractive forces between the solute particles holding them together.  There are also attractive forces between the solvent molecules.  When we mix the solute with the solvent, there are attractive forces between the solute particles and the solvent molecules.  If the attractions between solute and solvent are strong enough, the solute will dissolve.  Charge Distribution in a Water Molecule  Audio 0:25:45.466724  There is an uneven distribution of electronswithin the water molecule.          This causes the oxygen side of the molecule to have a partial negative charge (δ–) and the hydrogen side to have a partial positive charge (δ+).            Solute and Solvent Interactions in an Ionic Solution: A Salt Solution  Audio 0:26:59.261993  When sodium chloride is put into water, the attraction of Na+ and Cl– ions to water molecules competes with the attraction among the oppositely charged ions themselves.          Sodium chloride is an ionic compound (metal + nonmetal).      Ionic compounds when dissolved in water are called salt solutions.            Sodium Chloride (NaCl) Dissolving in Water  Each ion is attracted to the surrounding water molecules and pulled off and away from the crystal.  When it enters the solution, the ion is surrounded by water molecules, insulating it from other ions.  The result is a solution with free moving chargedparticles able to conduct electricity.  Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions  Audio 0:29:17.039172  Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will conduct electricity are called electrolytes.  Materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will not conduct electricity are called nonelectrolytes.  A solution of salt (an electrolyte) conducts electrical current. A solution of sugar (a nonelectrolyte) does not.  Salt versus Sugar Dissolved in Water NaCl solution Sugar–water solution  Electrolyte Solutions: What Are They?  Audio 0:31:02.947720  Electrolytes are classified by how they dissolve in water.          If their dissociation is into ions:                  Strong electrolytes                          Completely dissociate into ions              Example: CaCl2(s) → Ca2+ + 2 Cl−                                Weak electrolytes                          Partial dissociation into their ions              Example: HCOOH(aq) H+ + HCOO−                                          Molecular compounds that dissolve in water but do not form ions when they go into solution are called nonelectrolytes.      Electrolyte Solutions: Strong and Weak  Audio 0:32:53.074436  Ionic substances such as sodium chloride (NaCl) that completely dissociate into ions when they dissolve in water are strong electrolytes.                  Acids are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give H+  Bases are compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give OH-                  Depending on the acid or base, their dissociation in water can be complete or partial.          Example:                  HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid is a strong acid.                          It dissociates completely in water.                                  HCl would be a strong electrolyte.                                                              Acetic acid (e.g., vinegar) (HC2H3O2) is a weak acid—it dissociates partially in water.                          HC2H3O2 is a weak electrolyte.

Most molecular compounds (except for acids and bases) dissolve in water as intact molecules.                                      Nonelectrolyte solution      Electrolytic Properties of Solution  The Solubility of Ionic Compounds  Audio 0:39:50.836785  When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the resulting solution contains:          Not the intact ionic compound itself, but its component ions dissolved in water        NOT all ionic compounds dissolve in water.          Example:                  If we add AgCl to water, for example, it remains solid and appears as a white powder at the bottom of the water.                      In general, a compound is termed soluble if it dissolves in water and insoluble if it does not.Solubility of Salts  Audio 0:41:22.482755  If solid silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to water, it dissolves and forms a strong electrolyte solution.  Silver chloride (AgCl), on the other hand, is almost completely insoluble.          If solid AgCl is mixed with water, virtually all of it remains as a solid within the liquid water.        When Will a Salt Dissolve?  Audio 0:41:46.575491  Whether a particular compound is soluble or insoluble depends on several factors.  Predicting whether a compound will dissolve in water is not easy.  The best way to do it is to do some experiments to test whether a compound will dissolve in water, and then develop some rules based on those experimental results.Solubility Rules  Audio 0:41:59.485417  Practice Problem: Ionic Compound Solubility  Predict whether each compound is soluble or insoluble  (a) PbCl2  (b) CuCl2  (c) Ca(NO3)2  (d) BaSO4Vocab            Term      Definition                  electrolytes      materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will conduct electricity              nonelectrolytes      materials that dissolve in water to form a solution that will not conduct electricity are called              acids      compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give H+              bases      compounds that when dissolved in water dissociate to give OH-              soluble      compound which dissolves in water"

The salt is still there, as you can tell from the taste or simply boiling away the water.        Homogeneous mixtures are called solutions.  The component of the solution that changes state iscalled the solute.  The component that keeps its state is called the solvent.Solution Concentration: Categories  Audio 0:22:26.471631  Dilute solutions have a small amount of solute compared to solvent.  Concentrated solutions have a large amount of solute compared to solvent  Can also describe QuantitativelyOLD Solution Concentration: Molality  A (not so) common way to express a solution concentration is molality (M).

Molarity is the amount of solute (in moles) divided by the volume of solution (in liters).            Using Molarity in Calculations  Audio 0:26:25.553273  The molarity of a solution can be used as a conversionfactor between moles of the solute and liters of thesolution.

Solution Dilution: Making a Solution from a Solution: C1·V1 = C2·V2  Audio 0:37:43.525017  A dilution is when a new solution is prepared from a stock solution (more concentrated solution).  To make solutions of lower concentrations from these stock solutions, more solvent is added.          The amount of solute doesn’t change; just the volume of solution changes:                  moles solute in solution 1 = moles solute in solution 2          The concentrations and volumes of the stock and new solutions are inversely proportional.                      The mathematical relationship is C1·V1 = C2·V2,or if the concentration unit is Molarity, then it can be written as M1·V1 = M2·V2.Preparing 3.00 L of 0.500 M CaCl2 from a 10.0 M Stock Solution  Audio 0:40:33.998639  Practice Problem: Calculating Concentrations To what volume should 0.200 L of 15 M NaOH solution be diluted to give a 3 M NaOH solution?

How many pizzas can you make?  Strategy:  We have enough crusts to make   We have enough cheese to make   We have enough tomato sauce to make           If you are given two or more quantities or reactants, then it is a limiting reagent problem      Limiting Reactant: Pizza Problem Continued  We have enough crusts for 4 pizzas, enough cheese for 5 pizzas, but ONLY enough tomato sauce for 3 pizzas.          Therefore, only 3 pizzas can be made.      The tomato sauce limits how many pizzas can be made.            Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield Connection  Audio 0:32:11.720988  In the pizza analogy, the tomato sauce is the limiting reactant, the reactant that makes the least amount of product.          The limiting reactant is also known as the limiting reagent.        The maximum number of pizzas that can be made depends on this ingredient, the tomato sauce.          In chemical reactions, this is called the theoretical yield.        Theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.          Example:                  The ingredient that makes the least amount of pizza determines how many pizzas you can make (theoretical yield).                    More Making Pizzas  Audio 0:33:57.386964  Assume that while making pizzas, a pizza is burnt ordropped on the floor and only two pizzas are availableto eat.  The actual amount of product made in a chemical reaction is called the actual yield.  Actual yield is about efficiency.          To determine your efficiency in making pizzas, a percentage value can be calculated.      In chemical reactions, this is called a percent yield.            Summarizing Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield  Audio 0:35:14.485560  The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction and limits the amount of product.  The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant.  The theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.  The actual yield is the amount of product actually produced by a chemical reaction.  The percent yield is calculated as:          (actual yield /theoretical yield) × 100 = percent yield%      Chemical Reaction  In reactions with multiple reactants, it is likely that one of the reactants will be completely used before the others.          When this reactant is used up, the reaction stops and no more product is made.        The reactant that limits the amount of product is called the limiting reactant.          It is sometimes called the limiting reagent.      The limiting reactant gets completely consumed.        Reactants not completely consumed are called excess reactants.          The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant.        The amount of product that can be made from the limiting reactant is called the theoretical yield.Practice Problem: Stoichiometry—Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield          Audio 0:36:18.679366  Ammonia, NH3, can be synthesized by          2NO(g) + 3H2(g) è 2NH3(g) + 2H2O(g)        Starting with 86.3 g NO and 25.6 g H2, find the theoretical yield of NH3What is the percent yield of C2H2 if 62.80 g of water yields 15.38 g of C2H2 using the following equation.

We’re going to learn how to calculate thatPhysical Changes in MatterWhat is a physical change?  Audio 0:04:38.768317  Changes that alter only the state or appearance, but not composition, are physical changes.  The atoms or molecules that compose a substance do not change their identity during a physical change.    When water boils, it changes its state from a liquid to a gas.  The gas remains composed of water molecules, so this is a physical change.Chemical Changes in MatterWhat is a chemical change?  Audio 0:05:34.019413  Changes that alter the composition of matter are chemical changes.  During a chemical change, atoms rearrange, transforming the original substances into different substances.            A rusting nail is a chemical change.      Rust occurs when the iron atoms exchange electrons with oxygen atoms— combining to form a NEW or different chemical substance.      Iron rust is the compound iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3).

The total number of MOs formed from a particular set of AOs always equals the number of AOs in the set.        When two AOs combine to form two MOs, one MO is lower in energy (the bonding MO) and the other is higher in energy (the antibonding MO).  When assigning the electrons of a molecule to MOs, we fill the lowest energy MOs first with a maximum of two spin-paired electrons per orbital.  When assigning electrons to two MOs of the same energy, Hund’s rule is followed to fill the orbitals singly first, with parallel spins, before pairing.  The bond order in a diatomic molecule is the number of electrons in bonding MOs minus the number in antibonding MOs divided by two.          Stable bonds require a positive bond order (more electrons in bonding MOs than in antibonding MOs).        MOs are named by type: σ, π, with a subscript to indicate what AOs they were formed from.Practice Problem on Bond Order H2-  Audio 0:44:01.684960Period Two Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules  Interaction of p Orbitals    Molecular Orbital Energy Ordering  Practice Problem on Molecular Orbital Theory N2- ion.

C = 2s^2 2px^1 2py^1 2pz^0 would predict two or three bonds that are 90° apart, rather than four bonds that are 109.5° apart.        To adjust for these inconsistencies, it was postulatedthat the valence atomic orbitals could hybridize beforebonding took place.          One hybridization of C is to mix all the 2s and 2p orbitals to get four orbitals that point at the corners of a tetrahedron.      Hybridization  Audio 0:02:36.629512  Some atoms hybridize their orbitals to maximize bonding.          More bonds = more full orbitals = more stability        Hybridizing is mixing different types of orbitals in the valence shell to make a new set of degenerate orbitals.          sp, sp2 , sp3 , sp3d, sp3d2                  Four Hybrid orbitals                      The same type of atom can have different types ofhybridization.

Example for carbon:                  Combining a 2s with a 3p gives four sp3 hybrid orbitals.                    H cannot hybridize.

Between unhybridized parallel p orbitals        The interaction between parallel orbitals is not as strong as between orbitals that point at each other; therefore, σ bonds are stronger than π bonds.Bond Rotation  Audio 0:26:21.602225  Because of the orbitals that form the σ bond point along the internuclear axis, rotation around that bond does not require breaking the interaction between the orbitals.  But the orbitals that form the π bond interact above and below the internuclear axis, so rotation around the axis requires the breaking of the interaction between the orbitals.

Example:        Boiling points and solubilities          Like dissolves like        Nonbonding pairs affect molecular polarity, a strong pullMolecule Polarity  Audio 0:04:17.407335    The bond between the H atom and Cl atom in HCl molecule is polar.  The bonding electrons are pulled toward the Cl end of the molecule because Cl is more electronegative (EN) than the H atom.          The net result is a polar molecule.                  Second most electronegative element      Has polar bonds that are equally polar in opposite directions so the net result is that CO2 is not polar        The bond between the C atom and O atoms in CO2 moleculeis polar.  The bonding electrons are pulled toward the O ends of the molecule equally because O is more electronegative (EN) than the C atom.          The net result is a nonpolar molecule.      Audio 0:06:24.175803Molecule Polarity  The bond between the O atom and H atoms in H2O molecule is polar.  Both sets bonding electrons are pulled toward the O end of themolecule equally because O is more electronegative (EN) than theH atom.  Because of its geometry, the lone pairs do not negate the dipolemoment that result from the each of the O–H bonds.  The net result is a polar molecule.  Vector Addition  Audio 0:07:47.798794            Water is more like the bent scenario                  The sum of the bonds goes up so it’s polar (the vectors don’t cancel)                    For CO2 and a trigonal planar molecule the vectors are equally strong in directions that cancel eachother out so they are not polar.      Vector Addition: One Dimension  One Dimension:  To add two vectors that lie on the same line, assign one direction as positive.  Vectors pointing in that direction have positive magnitudes.  Consider vectors pointing in the opposite direction to have negative magnitudes.    Audio 0:09:58.418088  Just draw the first. Draw the second where the first ends and then calculate the net result.Vector Addition: Two or More Dimensions  Audio 0:10:34.308430Two or More Dimensions:  To add two vectors, draw a parallelogram in which the two vectors form two adjacent sides.  Draw the other two sides of the parallelogram parallel to and the same length as the two original vectors.  Draw the resultant vector beginning at the origin and extending to the far corner of the parallelogram as shown in Examples 4 and 5.  To add three or more vectors, add two of them together first, and then add the third vector to the result (Examples 6 and 7).  Molecular Polarity Affects Solubility in Water  Audio 0:13:22.721754  Polar molecules are attracted to other polar molecules.  Water is a polar molecule; therefore:          Other polar molecules will dissolve in water.      As well as ionic compounds        Some molecules have both polar and nonpolar parts.          Example: Soap molecule        Summarizing Determining Molecular Shape and Polarity  Audio 0:14:38.522158  Draw the Lewis structure for the molecule and determine itsmolecular geometry.  Determine if the molecule contains polar bonds.          A bond is polar if the two bonding atoms have sufficiently different electro negativities.      If the molecule contains polar bonds, superimpose a vector, pointing toward the more electronegative atom, on each bond.      Make the length of the vector proportional to the electronegativity difference between the bonding atoms.        Determine if the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole moment.          Sum the vectors corresponding to the polar bonds together. If the vectors sum to zero, the molecule is nonpolar.      If the vectors sum to a net vector, the molecule is polar      Practice Problem: Is a Molecule Polar?  Audio 0:15:19.845473  Is NH3 polar?                  Audio 0:17:55.560585  Does ozone have a dipole moment?          Yes            Chapter 7  Audio 0:23:53.507292  Chemical Bonding II  Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital Theory  A Magnetic Liquid: O2  Audio 0:24:34.873518  Oxygen is paramagnetic.  Paramagnetic material has unpaired electrons.  Lewis theory does not predict this result.  Problems with Lewis Theory  Audio 0:26:13.153424  Lewis theory generally predicts trends in properties, but it does not give good numerical predictions.          Example: bond strength and bond length        Lewis theory gives good first approximations of the bond angles in molecules, but it usually cannot be used to get the actual angle.  Resonance: Lewis theory cannot write one correctstructure for many molecules, and multiple resonancestructures is not “elegant”.  Lewis theory often does not predict the correct magnetic behavior of molecules.          For example, O2 is paramagnetic, although the Lewis structure predicts it is diamagnetic.      Valence Bond Approach  Audio 0:28:26.040824    Change in electron density as two hydrogen atoms approach each other.          Overlap in two 1s orbitals        Keep getting closer until nucleus&lt;=&gt;nucleus repulsion balances electron&lt;=&gt;nucleus attractionValence Bond Theory: Orbital Overlap and the Chemical Bond  Audio 0:30:39.283988  Valence Bond Theory: Orbital Overlap and the Chemical Bond  Applying quantum mechanics to molecules:  Bonds between atoms should occur when the orbitals on those atoms interact to make a bond.  Audio 0:33:58.699088  The kind of interaction depends on whether the orbitals align along the axis between the nuclei, oroutside the axis.  Orbital Diagram for the Formation of H2S  Audio 0:34:54.957208  Valence Bond Theory and NH3  Audio 0:36:55.262109    If the bonds form from overlap of 3 2p orbitals on nitrogen with the 1s orbital on each hydrogen atom, what would the molecular geometry of NH3 be?            The predicted geometry is wrong                  If use the 3 2p orbitals predict 90 degrees          Actual H-N-H bond angle is 107.30                    Hybridization – mixing of two or more atomic orbitals to form a new set of hybrid orbitals.  Audio 0:38:09.158442          Mix at least 2 nonequivalent atomic orbitals (e.g. sand p). Hybrid orbitals have very different shapefrom original atomic orbitals.      Number of hybrid orbitals is equal to number ofpure atomic orbitals used in the hybridizationprocess.      Covalent bonds are formed by:                  a. Overlap of hybrid orbitals with atomic orbitals          b. Overlap of hybrid orbitals with other hybrid orbitals                    Formation of sp3 Hybrid Orbitals  Audio 0:40:23.463058            When we hybridize them, we get tetrahedral geometry                  These are exactly the right geometry to give us the tetrahedral shape of ammonia      Summarizing Valence Bond Theory  Audio 0:43:00.758032  The valence electrons of the atoms in a molecule reside in quantummechanical atomic orbitals.  The orbitals can be the standard s, p, d, and f orbitals, or they may be hybrid combinations of these.  A chemical bond results from the overlap of two half-filled orbitals and spin-pairing of the two valence electrons (or less commonly the overlap of a completely filled orbital with an empty orbital).  The geometry of the overlapping orbitals determines the shape of the molecule.Valence Bond Theory: Main Concepts  The valence electrons of the atoms in a molecule reside in quantum-mechanical atomic orbitals. The orbitals can be the standard s, p, d, and f orbitals, or they may be hybrid combinations of these.  A chemical bond results when these atomic orbitalsinteract and there is a total of two electrons in the newmolecular orbital. a) The electrons must be spin paired.  The shape of the molecule is determined by the geometry of the interacting orbitals."

The structure includes many factors:          The skeletal arrangement of the atoms      The kind of bonding between the atoms        Ionic, polar covalent, or covalent  The shape of the molecule  Bonding theory predicts the shapes of molecules.What is Molecular Geometry?  Audio 0:08:43.125118  Molecules are three-dimensional objects.  Molecular geometries:          Describe the shape of a molecule with terms that relate to geometric figures      Have characteristic “corners” that indicate the positions of the surrounding atoms around a central atom in the center of the geometric figure        Have characteristic angles that are called bond anglesLewis Theory  Audio 0:09:38.911219  Lewis theory predicts there are regions of electron density in an atom. +  These regions of electron density should repel each otherbecause the regions are negatively charged.          Some regions result from placing shared pairs of valence electrons between bonding nuclei.        Other regions result from placing unshared valence electrons on a single nuclei.  These regions are called “electron groups”  Audio 0:10:23.928591  This idea can then be extended to predict the shapes of the molecules.          The position of atoms surrounding a central atom will be determined by where the bonding electron groups are.      The positions of the electron groups will be determined by trying to minimize repulsions between them.      VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) Theory  Audio 0:10:57.562360  Electron groups around the central atom will be most stable when they are as far apart as possible.          This is the basis for VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) theory.      Because electrons are negatively charged, they should be most stable when they are separated as much as possible.        The resulting geometric arrangement will allow us to predict the shapes and bond angles in the molecule.  Electron Groups  Audio 0:11:58.852503  The Lewis structure predicts the number of valenceelectron pairs around the central atoms.  Each lone pair of electrons constitutes one electron groupon a central atom.  Each bond constitutes one electron group on a centralatom, regardless of whether it is single, double, or triple.  Example: NO2            There are three electron groups on N:                  Three lone pairs          One single bond          One double bond                    Electron Group Geometry  Audio 0:12:41.207985  There are five basic arrangements of electron groups around acentral atom.          Arrangements are as follows:        Linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, bipyramidal, and octahedral  Based on a maximum of six bonding electron groups          Though there may be more than six on very large atoms, it is very rare.        Each of these five basic arrangements results in five different basicelectron geometries.          In order for the molecular shape and bond angles to be a “perfect” geometric figure, all the electron groups must be bonds and all the bonds must be equivalent.        For molecules that exhibit resonance, it doesn’t matter which resonance form you use as the electron geometry will be the sameValence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) model:  Audio 0:14:33.045667| Class | # of atoms bonded to central atom | # lone pairs on central atom | arrangements of electron groups | molecular geometry || — | — | — | — | — || AB2 | 2 | 0 |  |  |Beryllium Chloride  Audio 0:15:20.954184            Beryllium has two valence electrons      Linear molecule      Carbon dioxide            Double bonds but still linear      VSEPR says the Oxygens want to be as far away from each-other as possible      VSEPR  Audio 0:16:30.584774            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar       trigonal planar         To minimize electron repulsion, the atoms form a trigonal planar (or are 120 degrees angled from each-other)Boron Trifluoride  Audio 0:17:18.718797  More complicated  VSEPR  Audio 0:19:31.975550            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar      trigonal planar              AB4      4      0      tetrahedral       tetrahedral         tetrahedral is most common  VSEPR (trigonal)  Audio 0:21:35.070764            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar      trigonal planar              AB4      4      0      tetrahedral      tetrahedral              AB5      5      0      trigonal bipyramidal       trigonal bipyramidal       Phosphorus PentachlorideFive Electron Groups: Trigonal Bipyramidal  Audio 0:23:20.082880Electron Geometry  When there are five electron groups around the central atom, they will occupypositions in the shape of two tetrahedral that are base to base with the centralatom in the center of the shared bases.          This results in the electron groups taking a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.        The positions above and below the central atom are called theaxial positions.          The bond angle between axial and equatorial positions is 90°.        The positions in the same base plane as the central atom are calledthe equatorial positions.          The bond angle between equatorial positions is 120°.

This results in the electron groups taking an octahedral geometry.          It is called octahedral because the geometric figure has eight sides.        All positions are equivalent.          The bond angle is 90°.      HCN example. What is the molecular geometry?  Clicker 2  Audio 0:31:55.556328  Determine the electron geometry (eg) and the molecular geometry (mg) of CO3^2-          A) eg = tetrahedral, mg = tetrahedral      B) eg = tetrahedral, mg = trigonal pyramidal      C) eg = trigonal planar, mg = bent      D) eg = trigonal planar, mg = trigonal planar      E) eg = tetrahedral, mg = trigonal planar      Answer = DElectron Pair Geometry versus Molecular Geometry  The actual geometry of the molecule may be different from the electron geometry.  When the electron groups are attached to atoms of different size,or when the bonding to one atom is different from the bonding toanother, this will affect the molecular geometry around the centralatom.  Lone pairs affect the molecular geometry.  Lone pair groups: Occupy space on the central atom but are not“seen” as points on the molecular geometryBent Molecular Geometry: Derivative of Trigonal Planar Electron Geometry  Audio 0:33:48.975493            bent                  When there are three electron groups around the central atom, and one of them is a lone pair, the resulting shape of the molecule is called a trigonal planar-bent shape.      Pyramidal and Bent Molecular Geometries: Derivatives of Tetrahedral Electron Geometry  Audio 0:34:54.926890  When there are four electron groups around the central atom, and one is a lone pair, the result is called a pyramidal shape because it is a triangular-base pyramid with the central atom at the apex.  Pyramidal and Bent Molecular Geometries: Derivatives of Tetrahedral Electron Geometry  Audio 0:35:07.965087  When there are four electron groups around the central atom, and two are lone pairs, the result is called a tetrahedral-bent shape.          It is planar.      To a first approximation: trigonal planar-bent shape            Effect of Lone Pairs on Molecular Structure  Audio 0:36:21.514009  The bonding electrons are shared by two atoms, so some of the negative charge is removed from the central atom.    Relative sizes of repulsive force interactions are as follows:  LonepairtoLonepair&gt;LonepairtoBondingpair&gt;BondingpairtoBondingpair  Audio 0:37:42.812819  Derivatives of the Trigonal Bipyramidal Electron Geometry  Audio 0:40:22.114199  When there are five electron groups around the central atom, and some are lone pairs, they will occupy the equatorial positions because there is more room.          The bond angles between equatorial positions are less than 120°.      The bond angles between axial and equatorial positions are less than 90°.      Linear = 180° axial to axial.        When there are five electron groups around the central atom, and one is a lone pair, the result is called the seesaw shape or sawhorse (aka distorted tetrahedron).

When there are six electron groups around the central atom, and one is a lone pair, the result is called a square pyramid shape.          The bond angles between axial and equatorial positions are less than 90°.              Audio 0:44:31.634918  When there are six electron groups around the central atom, and some are lone pairs, each even number lone pair will take a positionopposite the previous lone pair.  When there are six electron groups around the central atom, and two are lone pairs, the result is called a square planar shape.

The change in energy for a reaction can beestimated by comparing the cost of breaking oldbonds to the energy released from making newbonds.  The amount of energy, in the gaseous state, that ittakes to break one mole of a bond in a compound is called the bond energy.

One atom pulls the electrons in the bond closer toits side.      One end of the bond has larger electron density thanthe other.        The result is a polar covalent bond.          Bond polarity      The end with the larger electron density gets a partialnegative charge.      The end that is electron deficient gets a partial positive charge.      Electronegativity (EN)  Audio 0:06:39.736104  A measure of an elements ability to pull electrons toward it  An empirical scale drawn from measured properties of manymolecules  provides “rule of thumb” to predict molecular propertiesElectronegativity  Audio 0:07:30.692317  The ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons to itself is called electronegativity.  An empirical scale drawn from measured properties of many molecules  provides “rule of thumb” to predict molecular properties  The larger the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond.          Negative end toward more electronegative atom        Audio 0:07:45.217060  Scale defined so Fluorine is the most electronegative,Francium the least  Increases across a period (left to right) and decreasesdown a group (top to bottom)          Noble gas atoms are not assigned EN values.

A dipole is a material with a + and − end.      It is directly proportional to the size of the partial charges (q) and directly proportional to the distance (r) between them.                  µ (dipole moment) = (q)(r)                    Measured in Debyes, D        Generally, the more electrons two atoms share and the larger the atoms are, the larger the dipole moment.  Electronegativity Difference and Bond Type  Audio 0:13:12.370573  If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is 0, the bond is pure covalent.          Equal sharing of the atoms in the bond      If the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0.1 to 0.4, the bond is nonpolar covalent.        If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is 0.5 to 1.9, the bond is polar covalent.          Unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms inthe bond        If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is larger than or equal to 2.0, the bond is ionic.Percent Ionic Character  Audio 0:15:43.076694  The percent ionic character is the percentage of a bond’s measured dipole moment compared to what it would be if the electrons were completely transferred.  The percent ionic character indicates the degree to which the electron is transferred.  Molecular Structure I: Octet Rule  Audio 0:16:44.675983  Generally eight electrons in valence shell  exceptions for H, Li, (2 electrons) and Beand B (only 2 and 3 electrons)  “Octet Expansion”: S, P, etc where canhave more than 8 electrons when centralatomWriting Lewis Structures for Molecular Compounds  Audio 0:17:58.111765  Write the correct skeletal structure for the molecule.          The less electronegative atom in the molecule is usually the center atom.                  Simple molecules have a “center” atom to which all of the other atoms in the molecules are attached (bonded) to.                          For example, for CO2, the center atom is C, so both O atoms are attached to the carbon atom.                                  Audio 0:18:55.177204                  O–C–O                                                                        The more electronegative atoms are usually terminal (attached to the center atom).                  Hydrogen atoms are always in the terminal position.                      Determine the total number of valence electrons each atom brings to form themolecule.          Examples:                  For the molecule H–Br: H atom brings 1 electron and Br atoms brings 7 electrons for a total 8 electrons          In polyatomic ions, the charge on the ion also must be accounted. For the polyatomic ion NO2 –, a total of 18 electrons are brought in: 5 electrons from N, total 12 from O (2 oxygen atoms × 2), and 2 from the 2+ charge.                    Writing Lewis Structures for Molecular Compounds  Audio 0:20:36.268038  Distribute the electrons among the atoms in the molecule giving octets (or duets in the case of hydrogen) to as many atoms as possible.          The best practice is to place two electrons around an atom at a time.                  Bonding pairs: electrons between two atoms          Nonbonding or lone pairs: electrons not participating in bonding but complete the atom’s “octet”                    The total number of electrons brought in must be accounted for in the Lewis structure and must not violate any criteria (i.e., H atoms can only have single bonds or two electrons total).        If any atoms lack an octet, form double or triple bonds as necessary to givethem octets.          Atoms that can multiple bond with each other or to themselves are as follows:                  Double bond (4 electrons or two pairs of electrons between atoms): C, O, N, S, &amp; P          Triple bond (6 electrons or three pairs of electrons between atoms): C,O, N, &amp; S                    Practice Problem Writing Lewis Structures for Polyatomic IonsNH4+  Audio 0:23:57.666020  O3  Resonance and Formal Charges  Audio 0:31:22.898676  Two additional concepts to write the bestpossible Lewis structures for a large numberof compounds  The concepts are:          Resonance, used when two or more valid Lewis structures can be drawn for the same compound      Formal charge, an electron bookkeeping system that allows us to discriminate between alternative Lewis structures      Resonance  Audio 0:32:45.308690  Lewis theory localizes the electrons between the atoms that are bondingtogether.  Extensions of Lewis theory suggest that there is some degree ofdelocalization of the electrons; the concept is called resonance.          Delocalization of charge helps to stabilize the molecule.        When there is more than one Lewis structure for a molecule that differ only in the position of the electrons, they are called resonance structures.          The actual molecule is a combination of the resonance forms—a resonance hybrid.      The molecule does not resonate between the two forms, though we often draw it that way.                  Example: O3 molecule                          Resonance hybrid: Just as the offspring of two different dog breeds is a hybrid that is intermediate between the two breeds (a), the structure of a resonance hybrid is intermediate between that of the contributing resonance structures (b).Ex  Audio 0:38:19.039491  Clicker  Audio 0:38:59.721909    Draw the Lewis structure for CO3^2- including any valid resonance structures.          two single bonds and one double bond      Formal Charge  Audio 0:42:50.124155  Are all Resonance Structures equally good?

The sum of all formal charges in an ion must equal the charge of the ion.      Small (or zero) formal charges on individual atoms are better than large ones.      When formal charge cannot be avoided, negative formal charge should reside on the most electronegative atom.        Audio 0:44:42.818811  Example: The molecule HF has 0 (zero) formal charge.          The formal charge on H atom: Formal charge = 1 − [0 + ½ (2)] = 0      The formal charge on F atom: Formal charge = 7 − [6 + ½ (2)] = 0            Vocab            Term      Definition                  empirical formula      simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms of elements in a compound              molecular compounds have _ melting points and boiling points      low              polar covalent bond      results from covalent bonding between unlike atoms results in unequal sharing of the electrons              electronegativity      the ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons to itself              electronegativity _ across a period      increases left to right              electronegativity _ down a group      decreases              dipole moment (µ)      measure of bond polarity (= q * r)              pure covalent      the bond is this when the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0              nonpolar covalent      if the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0.1 to 0.4, the bond is              percent ionic character      the percentage of a bond’s measured dipole moment compared to what it would be if the electrons were completely transferred              resonance      when two or more valid Lewis structures can be drawn for the same compound              formal charge      an electron bookkeeping system that allows us to discriminate between alternative Lewis structures              resonance structures      when there is more than one Lewis structure for a molecule that differ only in the position of the electrons              formal charge      charge an atom would have if all bonding electrons are shared equally between the bonded atoms"

You get five or six freebies                          If you’ve checked the electron configuration and it says you’re wrong, it may be the way the website works.                                            Audio 0:02:01.735946  Real world is complicated          He isn’t going to tell us anything that is wrong but everything we’re learning is a really watered-down, simplified version of the truth      Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation: Using NaCl as an Example  Audio 0:05:03.029702          Where we left offThe ionization energy of the metal is endothermic.              The electron affinity of the nonmetal is exothermic.                  Generally, the ionization energy of the metal is larger than the electron affinity of the nonmetal; therefore, the formation of the ionic compound should be endothermic.  But the heat of formation of most ionic compounds is exothermic and generally large.                Crystal Lattice and Lattice Energy of NaCl  Audio 0:05:58.951668          Part of the energy formula in the previous slide does not add up because it does not account for the lattice shape of the compound        Lattice energy          The extra stability that accompanies the formation of the crystal lattice is measured as the lattice energy.                  Audio 0:07:54.475155                              It is the energy released when the solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.                  Always exothermic                    Lattice energy is measured directly but is calculated from knowledge of other processes.      It depends directly on the size of charges and inversely on distance between ions.      (Coulomb’s law)      Audio 0:09:53.359903      The most stable lattice is a very difficult calculation      Ionic Bonding Model versus Reality  Audio 0:10:12.809739  implies that the positions of the ions in the crystal lattice are critical to the stability of the structure.  predicts that moving ions out of position should therefore be difficult, and ionic solids should be hard.          Ionic solids are relatively hard compared to most molecular solids.                  If you’ve ever touched a crystal, this is obvious                      implies that if the ions are displaced from their position in the crystal lattice, repulsive forces should occur.          this predicts that the crystal will become unstable and break apart. Theory predicts that ionic solids will be brittle.                  If you strike a crystal with a hammer, it will shatter because it becomes unstable                          The same is not true for metals                                Ionic solids are brittle. When struck, they shatter.                      Audio 0:13:21.487007  implies that, in the ionic solid, the ions are locked in position and cannot move around.  predicts that ionic solids should not conduct electricity.          Audio 0:12:23.638218      To conduct electricity, a material must have charged particles that are able to flow through the material.      Ionic solids do not conduct electricity.        implies that, in the liquid state or when dissolved in water, the ions will have the ability to move around.predicts that both a liquid ionic compound and an ionic compound dissolved in water should conduct electricity.          Ionic compounds conduct electricity in the liquid state or when dissolved in water.      Conductivity of NaCl  Audio 0:14:19.003024  In NaCl(s), the ions are stuck in position and not able to move to the charged rods.                  In NaCl(aq), the ions are separated and are able to move to the charged rods.                Ionic Bonding and the Crystal Lattice  Audio 0:14:34.266075  The extra energy that is released comes from the formation of a structure in which every cation is surrounded by anions and vice versa.          This structure is called a crystal lattice.        The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.          Electrostatic attraction is a nondirectional force.                  Therefore, there is no ionic molecule.                          The chemical formula is an empirical formula, simply giving the ratio of ions based on charge balance.                                            The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between cations and anions leading to the most stable arrangementIonic Compounds  Audio 0:16:15.553827  Ionic compounds are composed of cations (metals) and anions (nonmetals) bound together by ionic bonds.          Examples of ionic compounds:                  NaBr, Al2(CO3)3, CaHPO4, and MgSO4                      The basic unit of an ionic compound is the formula unit, the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions.          Example:                  The ionic compound table salt, with the formula unit NaCl, is composed of Na+ and Cl+ions in a one-to-one ratio.                      Summarizing Ionic Compound Formulas          Ionic compounds always contain positive and negative ions.      In a chemical formula, the sum of the charges of the positive ions (cations) must equal the sum of the charges of the negative ions (anions).      The formula of an ionic compound reflects the smallest whole-number ratio of ions.      Nomenclature: Naming Compounds  Audio 0:18:01.496531  Organic compounds: predominantly carbon Usually plus H, O, N, S  Inorganic compounds: everything else      Ionic Compounds: Cation followed by anion +-ide## Naming Ionic Compounds    Audio 0:19:25.857435  Ionic compounds can be categorized into two types, depending on the metal in the compound.  The first type contains a metal whose charge is invariant from one compound to another.  Whenever the metal in this first type of compound forms an ion, the ion always has the same charge.    Audio 0:21:00.382017  Metals with invariant charges                  common nonmetal anions                Naming Binary Ionic Compounds of Type I Cations  Audio 0:22:33.873986  Binary compounds contain only two different elements. The names of binary ionic compounds take the following form:  For example, the name for KCl consists of the name of the cation, potassium, followed by the base name of the anion, chlor, with the ending -ide.          KCl is potassium chloride.                  We know potasium is +1, we know Cl is -1, so we don’t have to write it                      The name for CaO consists of the name of the cation, calcium,followed by the base name of the anion, ox, with the ending -ide.          CaO is calcium oxide.      Chemical Nomenclature  Audio 0:23:49.504979  Ionic Compounds          often a metal + nonmetal      anion (nonmetal), add “ide” to element name        Clicker 1  Write the formula for calcium nitride          Ca_3N_2      Lewis Structure Model: Representing a Substance’s Valence Electrons  Audio 0:26:31.209408  The Lewis Model:          Valence electrons are represented as dots.                                        Lewis electron-dot structures (Lewis structures) depict the structural formula with its valence electrons.  Audio 0:27:52.445649  Lewis structures focus on valence electrons because chemical bonding involves the transfer or sharing of valence electrons between two or more atoms.Octet Rule: A Guideline for Molecule Formation  Audio 0:28:08.406107  When atoms bond, they tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to give a noble gas–like configuration.          ns2np6        Nonmetals: period 2 elements must obey the octet rule (i.e., eight valence electrons around each atom in the molecule).  Exceptions to the octet rule: Expanded octets          (Sometimes octet rule doesn’t work)      Audio 0:29:09.248458      They involve the nonmetal elements located in period 3 and below.      Nonmetals (period 3 on down in the periodic table) follow the octet rule when they are not the center atom.                  The center atom is the atom in the molecule that the other elements individually bond (attach) to.                    When they are the center atom, they can accommodate more than eight electrons.        Using empty valence d orbitals that are predicted by quantum theoryMultivalent Metals: Naming Type II Ionic Compounds  Audio 0:30:05.304852  The metals in this category tend to have multiple charges (i.e., multivalent cations):  Their charge cannot be predicted as in the case of most representative elements and must be noted in their name.  Transition and inner transition metals          Iron (Fe) forms a 2+ cation in some of its compounds and a 3+ cation in others.                  FeSO4: Here iron is a +2 cation (Fe2+).          Fe2(SO4)3: Here iron is a +3 cation (Fe3+).                      Many of the p-block metals          Not all p-block metals are multivalent.      Some main-group metals, such as Pb, Tl, and Sn, form more than one type of cation.      Type II Cation  Audio 0:31:26.941062  Naming Type II Binary Ionic Compounds— Example: CrBr3  Audio 0:32:36.900613  To name CrBr_3, cation + total anion charge = 0          Cr charge + 3(Br+charge) = 0      Since each Br has a –1 charge, then                  Cr charge + 3(–1) = 0          Cr charge + (–3) = 0          Cr = +3                    Hence, the cation Cr3+ is called chromium(III), and Br^- is called bromide.        The name for CrBr3 is chromium(III) bromide.Polyatomic Ions  Audio 0:33:44.947274Oxyanions  Audio 0:34:09.654184  Most polyatomic ions are oxyanions, anions containing oxygen and another element.  Noticethatwhenaseriesofoxyanionscontainsdifferent numbers of oxygen atoms, the oxyanions are named according to the number of oxygen atoms in the ion.  Iftherearetwoionsintheseries,          the one with more oxygen atoms has the ending -ate; and+the one with fewer has the ending -ite.        Forexample,          NO3+is nitrate SO_4^2+ is sulfate      NO2+is nitrite SO_3^2+ is sulfite        If there are more than two ions in the series, then the prefixes hypo-, meaning less than, and per-,meaning more than, are used.                Naming Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions  Audio 0:36:49.401712  Ionic compounds that contain a polyatomic ion rather than a simple anion (e.g., Cl–) are named in the same manner as binary ionic compounds, except that the name of the polyatomic ion used.          For example, NaNO2 is named according to                  its cation, Na+, sodium; and          its polyatomic anion, NO2–, nitrite.                    Hence, NaNO2 is sodium nitrite.

M(g)+1e− →M1−(g)+EA                      It is defined as exothermic (−) the release of energy. Butmay actually be endothermic (+) taking energy.          Some alkali earth metals’ and all noble gases’ electron affinities are endothermic.        The more energy that is released, the larger the electron affinity.          The more negative the number, the larger the EA.      Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA)  Audio 0:08:45.799510  General Trend for Main-Group Elements          EA increases across a period.

Halogens have the highest EA for any period  Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA) for Main-Group Elements  Audio 0:10:58.796812  Summarizing Electron Affinity for Main-Group Elements          Most groups (columns) of the periodic table do not exhibit any definite trend in electron affinity.        Among the group 1A metals, however, electron affinity becomes more positive as we move down the column (adding an electron becomes less exothermic).          Alkali metals (group 1A) decrease electron affinity down the column.        Generally irregular increase in EA from second period to third period          Group 5A generally has lower EA than expected because extra electron must pair up.      Groups 2A and 8A generally have very low EA because added electron goes into higher energy level or sublevel.        Electron affinity generally becomes more negative (adding an electron becomes more exothermic) as we move to the right across a period (row) in the periodic table.Characteristics of Metals versus Nonmetals  Audio 0:12:24.155206            Metals      Nonmetals                  malleable and ductile      brittle in solid State              shiny      dull              conduct heat and electricity      insulator              basic      acidic              form cations      form anions              lose electrons in reactions      gain electrons in reactions      Periodic Trend: Metallic Character  Audio 0:15:52.518767  Periodic Trend: Metallic Character  Metallic character is how closely an element’s properties match the ideal properties of a metal          More malleable and ductile, better conductor, and easier to ionize        Metallic character decreases left to right across a periodthe right  Metallic character increases down the column.

Audio 0:18:19.520679  Metallic Elements:  Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atom’s metallic character should          increase down a column because the valence electrons are not held as strongly;      decrease across a period because the valence electrons are held more strongly and the electron affinity increases.        Atomic radius increases down the column.  Melting point decreases down the column.          MP for metals are generally low        Density increases down the column.

The molecular compound of water, H2O                      Molecules are compounds.  The great diversity of substances that we find in nature is a direct result of the ability of elements to form many different compounds.Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Water  Audio 0:21:35.856576  The dramatic difference between the elements hydrogen and oxygen and the compound water is typical of the differences between elements and the compounds that they form.

Except for He, which has only two electrons        They are especially nonreactive.          He and Ne are practically inert.        The reason the noble gases are so nonreactive is that the electron configuration of the noble gases is especially stable.Electron Configuration and Ion Formation  Audio 0:15:50.407566  Ion formation can be predicted by an element’s location in the periodic table.  These atoms form ions that will result in an electron configuration that is the same as that of the nearest noble gas.  Metals form cations (positively charged atoms).          Alkali metals (group 1A) form only +1 cations.      Alkaline earth metals (group 2A) form only +2 cations.      Transition, inner transition, and p-block metals form a variety of charged cations.        Nonmetals form anions (negatively charged atoms).  Halogens (group 7A) usually gain one electron to form –1 anions.          Other nonmetals can form a variety of charged anions.

Core electrons efficiently shield electrons in the outermost principal energy level from nuclear charge.  Outermost electrons in the valence shell do not efficiently shield one another from nuclear charge.  Z is the nuclear charge, and S is the number of electrons in lower energy levels.          Electrons in the same energy level contribute to screening, but since their contribution is so small, they are not part of the calculation.        Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge  Audio 0:20:20.485159  There are several methods for measuring the radius of an atom,and they give slightly different numbers.  Van der Waals radius = nonbonding  Covalent radius = bonding radius  Atomic radius is an average radius of an atom based on measuring large numbers of compounds.  Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge  Audio 0:21:45.986365  Atomic radius decreases across a period (left to right). –  Adding electrons to the same valence shell          Effective nuclear charge increases.      Valence shell held closer        Atomic radius increases down a group.          Valence shell farther from nucleus      Effective nuclear charge fairly constant (expansionmostly due to increasing n)            Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements  Audio 0:25:24.843667  The size of an atom is related to the distance the valence electrons are from the nucleus.          The larger the orbital an electron is in, the farther its most probable distance will be from the nucleus, and the less attraction it will have for the nucleus.      Traversing down a group adds a principal energy level, and the larger the principal energy level an orbital is in, the larger its volume.      Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get larger down a column.      Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements  Audio 0:26:14.499563  The larger the effective nuclear charge an electron experiences, the stronger the attraction it will have for the nucleus.          The closer their average distance will be to the nucleus, the stronger the attraction the valence electrons have for the nucleus.      Traversing across a period increases the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons.      Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get smaller across a period.      Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Transition Elements  Audio 0:26:56.496332  Atoms in the same group increase in size down the column.  Atomic radii of transition metals are roughly the same size across the d block.          Much less difference than across main group elements      Valence shell ns2, not the (n − 1)d electrons      Effective nuclear charge on the ns2 electrons approximately the same      Ions: Magnetic Properties  Audio 0:27:41.873967  Electron configurations that result in unpaired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have a net magnetic field; this is calledparamagnetism.          Will be attracted to a magnetic field          Electron configurations that result in all paired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have no magnetic field; this is calleddiamagnetism.          Slightly repelled by a magnetic field        Radii of Atoms and Their Ions: Cations  Audio 0:30:05.119746  Cation radius is smaller than its corresponding atom radius.          Loose electrons experiencing small effective nuclear charge; remaining electrons those experiencing a larger effective nuclear charge        Traversing down a group increases the (n − 1) level, causing the cations to get larger.  Traversing to the right across a period increases the effective nuclear charge for isoelectronic cations, causing the cations to get smaller.    Audio 0:32:15.588321  isoelectronic = same number of electronsRadii of Atoms and Their Ions: Anions  Audio 0:32:32.478937  When atoms form anions, electrons are added to the valence shell.  Addition of electrons increases repulsion in valence shell without compensating increase in effective nuclear charge  The result is that the anion is larger than the atom. Traversing down a group increases the n level, causing the anions to get larger.  Traversing to the left across a period decreases the effective nuclear charge for isoelectronic anions, causing the anions to get larger.    oposite of what happens with cationsClicker 2  Place the following in order of increasing radius          Br-, Na+, Rb+      Na+, Rb+, Br-      Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)  Audio 0:37:37.889283  Ionization Energy (IE):  It is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or ion in the gas phase.

First Ionization Energy: Exceptions to the Trend  Audio 0:43:42.531942  GENERAL trend for first ionization energy of main-group elements is that as you go across a period, ionization energy increases.          Exceptions: 2A to 3A and 5A to 6A        Exceptions are usually a result of          the type of orbital (s, p, d, or f) and its shielding ability;      repulsion factors associated with electrons occupying degenerate orbitals (i.e., p orbitals).        B has smaller first ionization energy than Be due to electron position: 2p for B and 2s for Be.The electron in 2p orbitals has more shielding (i.e., lower effective nuclear charge) and therefore requires less energy for its removal than an electron in a 2s orbital.

Orbitals fill in the following order:                  1s2s2p3s3p4s3d4p5s4d5p6s.                      Orbitals can hold no more than two electrons each. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, their spins are opposite.

He found that when elements were listed in order of increasing mass, these similar properties recurred in a periodic pattern.  To be periodic means to exhibit a repeating pattern.The Periodic Law  Audio 0:26:52.707876  Mendeleev summarized these observations in the periodic law:          When the elements are arranged in order of increasing mass, certain sets of properties recur periodically.        Note: Mendeleev ignored some of data, e.g. atomic mass of Te &gt; atomic mass of lMendeleev’s Periodic Table  Audio 0:28:14.871013  Mendeleev’s periodic table          organized known elements of the time in a table format.                  He arranged the rows so that elements with similar properties would fall in the same vertical columns.                    contained some gaps, which allowed him to predict the existence (and even the properties) of yet undiscovered elements.                  Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element he called eka-silicon.                          The Modern Periodic Table: Its Format  Audio 0:29:46.955888  The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number rather than increasing relative mass as they were in Mendeleev’s periodic table.                  Rows of the table are referred to as periods (or just plain rows).  Columns in the table are referred to as groups or a family.          Elements in a group or family have similar properties.      NOTE: Mendeleev’s periodic law predicts pattern but does NOT explain why the patterns or similarity in properties occurs.                  Quantum theory explains the why                    Modern Periodic Table  Audio 0:31:45.843466  Core Electrons, Valence Electrons, and the Periodic Table  Audio 0:32:14.303407  The group number corresponds to the number of electrons in last (unfilled valence shell)          valence electrons        The length of each “block” is the maximum number ofelectrons the sublevel can hold.  The period number corresponds to the principal energy level of the valence electrons.                Orbital blocks and their position in the periodic table  Transition and Inner Transition Metals  Audio 0:34:11.820224  Transition metals (d block) and inner transition metals (f block) exhibit trends differing from those of main-group elements (s block and p block).          Because of sublevel splitting, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel; therefore, the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital.      The difference in energy is not large.        Some of the transition metals have irregular electron configurations in which the ns only partially fills before the (n − 1)d or doesn’t fill at all.          Therefore, their electron configuration must be found experimentally.      Examples of Transition and Inner Transition Metals’ Electron Configurations  Audio 0:36:43.269485    Remember chromium and copperClicker 3  Give the ground state electron configuration for Br-          [Ar]4s2 3d10 4p6      has one more electron than normal because the sign is negative so 4p6      Electron Configuration and Elemental Properties  Audio 0:42:21.308974  The properties of the elements follow a periodic pattern.          Elements in the same column have similar properties.      The elements in a period show a pattern that repeats.        The quantum-mechanical model explains this because the number of valence electrons and the types of orbitals they occupy are also periodic.

For like charges, the potential energy (E) is positive and decreases as the particles get farther apart as r increases.      For opposite charges, the potential energy is negative and becomes more negative as the particles get closer together.      The strength of the interaction increases as the size of the charges increases.

In the fourth and fifth principal levels, the effects of penetration become so important that the s orbital lies lower in energy than the d orbitals of the previous principal level.  The energy separations between one set of orbitals and the next become smaller beyond the 4s orbital.

What the question is asking you to do is identify a pair of isotopes of the same element. One must understand that all variations of an element (even the most common) is an isotope. A pair of isotopes would be of the same element (meaning same atomic number / number of protons). The only options with the same atomic numbers are A and C which have an atomic number of 21.

We look at the periodic table and find that the element with atomic number 12 is magnesium (Mg). However, this is not the end of the problem. Neutrons do not affect the answer because the answers do not show isotopes, but electrons (e-) do affect the answer because some of the answers show a non-neutral charge. Because p+ = 12 and e- = 10, there are more positive charges than negative charges in the atom, making the overall charge 2+ (two more protons than neutrons).

We look at the periodic table and find that the element with atomic number 47 is silver (Ag). However, this is not the end of the problem. Neutrons do not affect the answer because the answers do not show isotopes, but electrons (e-) do affect the answer because some of the answers show a non-neutral charge. Because p+ = 12 and e- = 10, there are more positive charges than negative charges in the atom, making the overall charge 2+ (two more protons than neutrons).

There are four quantum numbers:                  Principal quantum number,n                          Energy level                                          Angular momentum quantum number, l                  Orbital type                      Magnetic quantum number, ml          Audio 0:14:21.378733      Position of orbital in an X-Y-Z plot        Spin quantum number, ms          Orientation of the spin of the electron        These quantum numbers control how electrons are distributed in an atomPrincipal Quantum Number, n: The Energy Level  Audio 0:15:13.929935  It characterizes the energy of the electron in a particular orbital.          It is Bohr’s energy level.        Values of n can be any whole number integer &gt;= 1.  It determines the size (overall) and energy of an orbital.  The larger the value of n, the more energy the orbital has.  The larger the value of n, the larger the orbital.  Audio 0:17:10.934989  Energies are defined as being “negative.”          An electron’s energy is lowered (made more negative) as a result of its interaction with the nucleus of the atom.                  An electron would have E = 0 when it escapes the atom.                    As n gets larger, the following occurs:                  The amount of energy between orbitals gets smaller.          The energy of the orbital becomes greater (less negative).                                Won’t have to memorize this, but will need to know the energy is about 1/n^2        Rydberg constant for hydrogen (R_h) is 2.10 * 10^-8 JPrincipal Energy Level in  Audio 0:18:47.513089  Angular Momentum Quantum Number, l: The Orbital Quantum Number  Audio 0:19:37.169700  The angular momentum quantum number determines the shape of the orbital.          l can have integer values from 0 to (n – 1).                  Ex n = 1                          Only l=0 is allowed                                n = 2                          l = 0 or l = 1 are allowed                                            Each value of l is designated by a particular letter thatdesignates the shape of the orbital.          s orbitals are spherical.      p orbitals are like two balloons tied at the knots (dumbbell shape).      d orbitals are mainly like four balloons tied at the knots.      f orbitals are mainly like eight balloons tied at the knots.      Magnetic Quantum Number, ml: The Position or Orientation Quantum Number  Audio 0:22:55.744076  The magnetic quantum number is an integer that specifies the orientation of the orbital.          The direction in space the orbital is aligned relative to the other orbitals        Values are integers from −l to +l.          Including zero      Gives the number of orbitals of a particular shape                  When l=2,the values of ml are−2,−1,0,+1,+2, which means there are five orbitals with l = 2.                    Describing an Orbital  Audio 0:24:11.173521  Each set of n, l, and ml describes one orbital.  Orbitals with the same value of n are in thesame principal energy level.          Also called the principal shell        Orbitals with the same values of n and l are said to be in the same sublevel.          Also called a subshell      Illustration of Energy Levels and Sublevels  Audio 0:25:57.120934  Energy Levels and Sublevels  Audio 0:26:50.216152  In general:          The number of sublevels within a level = n      the number of orbitals within a level = 2l + 1      The number of orbitals in a level = n^2      Quantum Leaps  Audio 0:27:59.907574            When  an electron falls from a higher to lower energy level, light is emitted                  An unstable state is when an electron is sitting in a state greater than 1                    How Does the Quantum Mechanical Model of an Atom Explain Atomic Spectra?  Audio 0:29:26.973235  Each wavelength in the spectrum of an atom corresponds to an electron transition betweenorbitals.  When an electron is excited, it transitions from an orbital in a lower energy level to an orbital in a higher energy level.  When an electron relaxes, it transitions from an orbital in a higher energy level to an orbital in a lower energy level.  When an electron relaxes, a photon of light is released whose energy equals the energy difference between the orbitals.It Explains Electron Transitions  Audio 0:30:54.218927  To transition to a higher energy state, the electron must gain the correct amount of energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.  Electrons in high energy states are unstable and tend to lose energy and transition to lower energy states.  Each line in the emission spectrum corresponds to the difference in energy between two energy states.It Predicts the Spectrum of Hydrogen  Audio 0:31:35.930644• For an electron in an energy state n, there are (n–1) energy states it can transition to. Therefore, it can generate (n – 1) lines.Energy Transitions in Hydrogen  Audio 0:32:20.175336  The energy of a photon released is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels the electron is jumping between.  It can be calculated by subtracting the energy of the initial state from the energy of the final state.                Don’t have to memorize this, just remember the 1/n^2 part      Transitions    Audio 0:36:02.535972Example problem  Audio 0:37:09.180400  Calculate the wavelength (in nm) of a photon emitted by a hydrogen atom when its electron drops from the n = 5 state to the n = 3 state.

Examples of Spectra  Audio 0:30:24.253251    Each element has its own emission spectrum  All of this points to atoms emitting and absorbing light / energy in discrete packetsThe Bohr Model of the Atom  Audio 0:31:23.054768  The nuclear model of the atom (Rutherford model) does not explain what structural changes occur when the atom gains or loses energy.          He hypothesized that only certain orbits are allowed and came up with a model which predicted what was observed        Bohr developed a model of the atom to explain how the structure of the atom changes when it undergoes energy transitions.  Bohr’s major idea was that the energy of the atom was quantized, and that the amount of energy in the atom was related to the electron’s position in the atom.          Quantized means that the atom could have only very specific amounts of energy.      Bohr’s Model  Audio 0:32:22.750198  The electrons travel in orbits that are at a fixed distance from the nucleus.          Found different shapes of orbits      Stationary states      Therefore, the energy of the electron was proportional to the distance the orbit was from the nucleus.        Electrons emit radiation when they “jump” from an orbit with higher energy down to an orbit with lower energy.          Audio 0:32:58.969212      The emitted radiation was a photon of light.

Interference Types:          Constructive interference: waves that interact so that they make a larger wave are said to be in phase                                      Destructive interference: Waves that interact so that they cancel each other out are said to be out of phase                                      Two-Slit Interference  Audio 0:38:15.810042    Diffraction pattern          Either it goes through a slit or it doesn’t      Wave Behavior Properties: Diffraction  Audio 0:38:41.975443  When traveling waves encounter an obstacle or opening in a barrier that is about the same size as the wavelength, they bend around it; this is called diffraction.          Traveling particles do not diffract        The diffraction of light through two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wavelength results in an interference pattern of the diffracted waves.  An interference pattern is a characteristic of all light waves.  Wave Behavior of Electrons  Audio 0:39:38.320960  De Broglie proposed that particles could have wavelike character.  De Broglie predicted that the wavelength of a particle was inversely proportional to its momentum.  Because it is so small, the wave character of electrons is significant.  De Broglie relation                Example problem  Audio 0:40:32.639227  What are the de Broglie wavelengths (in nm) associated with an electron traveling at 6.0 * 10^5 ms-1 and a 52.5 g Ping-Pong ball traveling at 15.6 m/s?                Vocab            Term      Definition                  wave particle duality of light      describes that light acts like a wave and a particle in different scenarios              photon      particle of light              quantized      Property of atoms meaning that the atom could have only very specific amounts of energy              constructive interference (in phase)      occurs when waves that interact so that they make a larger wave              destructive interference (out of phase)      occurs when waves interact so that they cancel each other out              diffraction      occurs when waves bend around an obstacle or opening in a barrier which is about the same size as the wavelength"

Chapter 3  Audio 0:18:47.526137Properties of Waves  Audio 0:19:09.721677    Wavelength (λ) is the distance between identical points on successive waves.  Amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline of a wave to the peak or trough.  Audio 0:20:20.914304    Frequency (ν) is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in 1 second (Hz = 1 cycle/s).  Audio 0:21:32.710413  The speed (v) of the wave = λ x νLight  Audio 0:23:42.023732  Amplitude and Wavelength  Audio 0:24:52.722734  Wavelength and amplitude are independent properties.          The wavelength of light determines its color (intensive physical property).        The amplitude, or intensity, determines its brightness (extensive physical property)          Brightness dependent on amplitude        Color  Audio 0:26:15.944132  The color of light is determined by its wavelength or frequency.  White light is a mixture of all the colors of visible light.          A spectrum      Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet        When an object absorbs some of the wavelengths of white light and reflects others, it appears colored; the observed color is predominantly the colors reflected.Maxwell  Audio 0:26:23.185612  Maxwell (1873), proposed that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves.  Electromagnetic Spectrum  Audio 0:29:13.853883  Example problem  Audio 0:30:56.499318  An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 6.0 x 10^4 Hz. Does this frequency fall in the visible region? Convert this frequency into wavelength (nm).                Clicker Question  Audio 0:34:13.178546  What is the wave length of a wave with frequency 8.6 * 10^13 Hz?  Einstein and the Photoelectronic Effect  Audio 0:39:00.844561  Hertz observed that when (some) light shines on a metal surface, electrons are produced from the surface.          The electrons emitted from the metal surface are photoelectrons.      This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect.              Audio 0:40:20.734175          Number of electrons depends upon light intensity      More Kinetic energy at higher frequency of light      Emission has a frequency threshold, below which there are no electrons        Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:05.218727  Classic theory explanation:          The photoelectric effect according to classic wave theory attributed the electrons’ being emitted from the metal surface to the light energy being transferred to the electrons.      Classic theory states the following:                  If the wavelength of light is made shorter or the light wave’sintensity is made brighter, more electrons should be ejected.          Energy of a wave is directly proportional to its amplitude and its frequency.                          Example: If a dim light is used there should be a lag time before electrons are emitted in order to give the electrons time to absorb enough energy.                                          Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:13.093629  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Experimental observations indicate the following:                  A minimum frequency was needed before electrons would be emitted regardless of the intensity called the threshold frequency.          High-frequency light from a dim source caused electron emission without any lag time.                    Einstein’s idea: “Light Is Quantized.”  Audio 0:43:33.274758  Ejection of electrons from a metal surface by light:          One photon at the threshold frequency gives the electron just enough energy for it to escape the atom.      Binding energy, φ      When irradiated with a shorter wavelength photon, the electron absorbs more energy than is necessary to escape.      This excess energy becomes kinetic energy of the ejected electron.                                      Where (hυ) is a quantized packet of energy      Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Einstein proposed that the light energy was delivered to the atoms in packets called quanta or photons.                  Energy = (hυ)                          hυ = quanta                                          The energy of a photon of light is directly proportional to its frequency.                  E = hc/λ          Or it is inversely proportional to its wavelength.                    Symbols:                  Planck’s Constant, (h) is a proportionality constant with a value of h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s.          Speed of light (c) value is 3.00 × 108 m/s                    Black Body Radiation  Audio 0:46:37.258672    If you heat something up in the dark, you can see it with infrared radiation  “Black Body Problem” Solved by Planck in 1900“… an act of despair … I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics …”Energy (light) is emitted or absorbed in discrete units (quantum).

Ex: How many mL are in 1.63 L?  Ex: The speed of sound in air is about 343 m/s. What is this speed in miles per hour? (1 mile = 1.609 km)  Audio 0:20:52.486829  What is a Mole?  Audio 0:23:59.232240  A mole is a scientist’s “baker’s dozen.”          When we count large numbers of objects, we often use units such as                  1 dozen objects = 12 objects          1 gross objects = 144 objects.                      A mole (mol) of anything contains 6.02214 × 1023 pieces.          Examples:                  1 mol of marbles corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 marbles.          1 mol of sand grains corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 sand grains.                      This number is Avogadro’s number.The Mole  Audio 0:26:54.511808  The second, and more fundamental, thing to understand about the mole is how it gets its specific value.  The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of pure C-12.  12 g C = 1 mol C atoms = 6.022×10^23 C atomsMole Conversions: Atoms to Moles or Moles to Atoms  Audio 0:28:02.694268  Converting between number of moles and number of atoms is similar to converting between dozens of eggs and number of eggs.  For atoms, you use the conversion factor 1 mol atoms = 6.022 × 1023 atoms.  The conversion factors take the following forms:                Converting between Mass and Moles  Audio 0:28:55.905682  The molar mass of any element is the conversion factor between the mass (in grams) of that element and the amount (in moles) of that element.  Example:          12.01 g C atoms = 1 mol C atoms      or 12.01 g C atoms/1 mol C atoms      or 1 mol C atoms/12.01 g C atoms      Mass to Moles to Number of Particles: The Conceptual Plan  Audio 0:30:08.760686  Converting between Mass and Moles  Audio 0:31:09.351315  How many copper atoms are in a copper penny with a mass of 3.10 g?(Assume that the penny is composed of pure copper: Molar Mass of Copper: 63.55 g/mol)Ex: Converting mass and moles  How many copper atoms are in a copper penny with a mass of 3.10 g?

Most of the volume of the atom is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively charged electrons are dispersed.      There are many negatively charged electrons outside the nucleus as there are positively charged particles (named protons) within the nucleus, so that the atom is electrically neutral.      Protons (and Neutrons)  Audio 0:17:40.279234  Had bare proton (nucleus of hydrogen) Charge of alpha particle x 2 proton  Mass of alpha particle x 4 proton  So must be something else in the nucleus          Neutron      Chadwick’s Experiment (1932)  Audio 0:18:21.136318  The Atom’s Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:20:04.055851  All atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles:          Protons      Neutrons      Electrons        Protons and neutrons have nearly identical masses          The mass of the proton is 1.67262 * 10^-27 kg      The mass of the neutron is 1.67493 × 10^–27 kg.      The mass of the electron is 9.1 × 10^31 kg.        The charge of the proton and the charge of the electron are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. The neutron has no charge.Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:21:17.788117  Elements: Defined by Their Numbers of Protons  The most important number to the identity of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus.  The number of protons defines the element.  The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is itsatomic number and is given the symbol Z.Isotopes: Elements with Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:24:33.380011  All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; however, they do not necessarily have the same number of neutrons.          Example:                  All neon atoms contain 10 protons, but theymay contain 10, 11, or 12 neutrons.          All three types of neon atoms exist, and each has a slightly different mass.                                Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:26:45.772174  The sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is its mass number and is represented by the symbol A.    X is the chemical symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:28:13.708943  A second common notation for isotopes is the chemical symbol (or chemical name) followed by a dash and the mass number of the isotope.  Isotopes: Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:28:56.545513  The relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a given element is roughly constant.  The percentages are called the natural abundance of the isotopes.  Clicker Question  Audio 0:32:59.698445  What is the atomic number (Z), mass number (A), of chlorine with 18 neutrons?  Z = 17, A = 35 (or 17 + 18)Ions: Charged Atoms Losing and Gaining Electrons  Audio 0:34:19.624557  The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus (designated by its atomic number Z).  In chemical changes, however, atoms can lose or gain electrons and become charged particles called ions.          Positively charged ions are called cations.                  Metal elements, such as Na+, form cations.                    Negatively charged ions are called anions.                  Nonmetal elements, such as F–, form anions.                    Atomic Mass: The Average Mass of an Element’s Atoms  Audio 0:36:03.449187  Atomic mass is sometimes called the atomic weight or standard atomic weight.  The atomic mass of each element is directly beneath the element’s symbol in the periodic table.  The atomic mass of an element represents the average mass of the isotopes that compose that element          It is a weighted value based on the element’s natural abundance of each isotope.          Audio 0:36:29.805279  Mass Spectrometry: Measuring the Mass of Atoms and Molecules  The masses of atoms and the percent abundances of isotopes of elements are measured using mass spectrometry—a technique that separates particles according to their mass.  Atomic Mass: Problem  Naturally occurring chlorine consists of 75.77% chlorine-35 atoms (mass 34.97 amu) and 24.23% chlorine-37 atoms (mass 36.97 amu).  Calculate chlorine’s atomic mass.  Audio 0:39:29.943281  75.77 % / 100 % * 34.97 amu + 24.23%/100% * 36.97 amuVocab            term      definition                  atomic number      number of protons in an atom’s nucleus (Z)              isotopes      atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons              mass number      the sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom              natural abundance      the relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a given element (it is roughly constant)              atomic structure      highly condensed mass in nucleus with mostly empty space in electron cloud              nucleus      the small core of an atom (contains most of it’s mass and the positive charge)              protons      positively charged particles (in the nucleus of an atom)              cations      positively charged ions              anions      negatively charged ions              mass spectrometry      technique that separates particles according to their mass"

Democritus wrote, “Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.”                  He proposed that atoms existed in different shapes and sizes and moved randomly through empty space.                      Plato and Aristotle did not embrace the atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          They held that matter had no smallest parts.      They proposed that different substances were composed of various proportions of fire, air, earth, and water.      Early Building Blocks of Matter Ideas  Audio 0:24:38.965354  An English chemist, John Dalton (1766–1844) offered convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          Dalton’s atomic theory of matter        Modern Atomic Theory and Its Laws:          Law of conservation of mass      Law of definite proportions      Law of multiple proportions      John Dalton and the Atomic Theory  John Dalton and the Atomic Theory          Each element is composed of tiny indestructible particles called atoms.      All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements      Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds      Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, atoms change only the way that they are bound together with other atoms.      The Law of Conservation of Mass  Audio 0:27:20.929720  Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conservation of mass, which states the following:          In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.        When a chemical reaction occurs, the total mass of the substances involved in the reaction does not change.          This law is consistent with the idea that matter is composed of small, indestructible particles.        Audio 0:28:53.424491  The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:29:25.280225  In 1797 a French chemist named Joseph Proust made observations on the composition of compounds  He summarized his observations in the law of definite proportions:          All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent elements.        The law of definite proportions is sometimes called the law of constant composition.An Example of the Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:02.047142  The decomposition of 18.0 g of water (H2O) results in 16.0 g of oxygen (O2) and 2.0 g of hydrogen (H2)  an oxygen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 8:1.  Problem Solving: The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:39.294000  Two samples of carbon dioxide decompose into their constituent elements. One produces 25.6 g oxygen and 9.60 g carbon, the other 21.6 g oxygen, and 8.10 g carbon. Show that these results are consistent with the law of definite proportions.The Law of Multiple Proportions  Audio 0:34:08.719405  In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions:          When two elements (call them A and B) form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine with 1 g of element A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.                  When an atom of A combines with either one, two, three, or more atoms of B, the following molecular compounds are possible: AB1, AB2, AB3, etc.                      Audio 0:36:00.257154  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are two compounds composed of the same two elements: carbon and oxygen.                The mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1; therefore, 2.67 g of oxygen reacts with 1 g of carbon.      In carbon monoxide, however, the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon is 1.33:1, or 1.33 g of oxygen to every 1 g of carbon.        The ratio of these two masses is itself a small whole number                Problem Solving: The Law of Multiple Proportions  Nitrogen forms a number of compounds with oxygen. Measurements of the masses of nitrogen and oxygen that form upon decomposing these compounds show that nitrogen dioxide contains 2.28 g oxygen to every 1.00 g of nitrogen, while dinitrogen monoxide contains 0.570 g oxygen to every 1.00 g nitrogen. Show that the results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions:                            4 is a small whole number which coincides with the law of multiple proportions                    The Structure of the AtomThe Discovery of the Electron  Audio 0:41:57.987686  From J. J. Thomson’s (1856–1940) cathode rays experiments, it was observed that          a beam of particles, called cathode rays, traveled from the negatively charged electrode (called the cathode) to the positively charged one (called the anode);      the particles that compose the cathode ray have the following properties:                  They travel in straight lines.          They are independent of the composition of the material from which they originate (the cathode).          They carry a negative electrical charge.                      J.J. Thomson was able to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles by deflecting them using electric and magnetic fields, as shown in the figure on the bottom of the next slide.          The value he measured was –1.76 × 103 coulombs per gram. © 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.

An element is a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.          Basic building blocks of matter      Composed of single type of atom, like helium        A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions.  Most elements are chemically reactive and combine with other elements to form compounds.Heterogeneous Mixture  A heterogeneous mixture is one in which the composition varies from one region of the mixture to another.          Made of multiple substances, whose presence can be seen (example: a salt and sand mixture)                  Portions of a sample of a heterogeneous mixture have different composition and properties.                    Homogeneous Mixture  A homogeneous mixture is one made of multiple substances, but it appears to be one substance.  All portions of a sample have the same composition and properties (like sweetened tea).  Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Audio 0:12:42.707245  The approach to scientific knowledge is empirical  It is based on observation and experimentation.  The scientific method is a process for understanding nature by observing nature and its behavior through experimentation.  Key characteristics of the scientific method          Observations      Formulation of hypotheses      Experimentation      Formulation of laws and theories      Observations  Observations:          They are also known as data.      They are the descriptions about the characteristics or behavior of nature.        Observations, verification of observations, and experimentation can lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Scientists try to understand the universe through empirical knowledge gained through observation and experimentGathering Empirical Knowledge ─ Observation  Some observations are descriptions of the characteristics or behavior of nature ─ qualitative  Some observations compare a characteristic to a standard numerical scale ─ quantitativeFrom Observation to Understanding  Audio 0:15:58.585935  Hypothesis – a tentative interpretation or explanation for an observation  A good hypothesis is one that can be tested to be proved wrong!Testing Ideas  Audio 0:17:57.155168  Ideas in science are tested with experiments  An experiment is a set of highly controlled procedures designed to test whether an idea about nature is valid  The experiment generates observations that will either validate or invalidate the ideaIs this a good hypothesis?

Jombert, Paris (1997)        D’Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ….Unfortunately he carried [his]… pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong…          Thomas L. Hankins (1990). Jean D’Alembert: Science and the Enlightenment. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 236.

Scientific data can be either qualifiable or quantifiable          Qualifiable data are observational                  Subjective in nature          Examples: color, shape                      Quantifiable data are measurable (empirical).          Objective in nature      Uses equipment (e.g., glassware, balance, instrumentation) capable of generating empirical data with standardized UNITS.

Although the atoms and molecules in a solidvibrate, they do not move around or pasteach other.  Consequently, a solid has a fixed volume andrigid shape.          Ice, aluminum, and diamond are good examplesof solids.      Liquid Matter  In liquid matter, atoms or molecules pack about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each other.  Liquids have fixed volume but not a fixed shape.  Liquids’ ability to flow makes them assume the shape of their container.          Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at room temperature.      Gaseous Matter  In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them.  They are free to move relative to one another.  Fill available space  These qualities make gases compressible.Classification of Matter by Components  Matter can be classified according to its composition: elements, compounds, and mixtures.  a pure substance is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant  a mixture is a substance composed of two or more components in proportions that can vary from one sample to another  Vocab            Term      Definition                  matter      anything that has mass and occupies space (e.g. has volume)              atoms      Basic submicroscopic particles that constitute the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter              molecules      Substances formed when two or more atoms come together (bond) in specific geometric arrangements              chemistry      a discipline that seeks to understand matter and its properties, and the transformations that matter undergoes- particularly between molecules              state      physical form of matter based on what properties it exhibits (i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.

A survey of the fundamental facts, principles, and theories of general chemistry. Usually offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.Student Learning OutcomesThe objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles that form the foundations of chemistry.  An understanding of the quantum mechanical model of atoms provides the basis for understanding atomic structure, which in turn predicts the physical and chemical properties of atoms, as illustrated in the periodic table of the elements.  This understanding provides the basis for understanding the nature of chemical bonds: ionic and covalent.  An understanding of chemical bonds in turn provides the basis for predicting the structures of molecules, and a qualitative understanding of chemical reactions.  A quantitative understanding of the energy of atoms and molecules will provide the basis for predicting the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions and the accompanying release or absorption of heat.  The last objective is to be able to quantitatively predict the properties of gases and understand how the speed of molecular motion relates to the chemical and physical properties of gases and gas mixtures.Required Texts  TURNING TECH / NXT CLICKER (Required)  TRO (CUSTOM) / Chemistry: Structure and Properties Package for University of Alabama, 1/e (Required)Exams and AssignmentsExams 1 – 3 will be given on Wednesday September 7th, October 5th and November 9th from 6:30 - 7:50 PM 127 BiologyFinal Exam:  Monday.  December 5th, 2016 11:30 AM—2:00 PM 127 BiologyA. ExamsYou must bring your ACT card, driver’s license, or other photographic identification to all exams in order to receive a grade.  Students are strongly encouraged to take all regularly scheduled exams. However, should you have to miss one of these exams it will become your drop grade.  If you miss a second exam and can provide a written, reasonable excuse, you will be permitted to use your score (calculated as a percent) on the final exam as a makeup score for the test you missed.  No make-up exams will be given.  No programmable calculators, or calculators that solve polynomial equations, language translators, pagers, cell phones or similar electronic devices are allowed.B. QuizzesQuizzes will be given most every non-test week.  Electronic quizzes will be given either in the Wednesday afternoon recitation sessions or in the lecture classes using the Turning Point response units (“Clicker”).  The response units may be purchased in the SUPE Store (in the Ferguson Center).  It is your responsibility to make sure that your response unit is working, including its batteries, and you must bring it to every class meeting and recitation session.  Your lowest two or three quiz scores will be dropped, and the remainder will be used towards a maximum of 50 points; however, all quizzes will count toward your attendance points.  50% of a questions value will be attendance, 50% will be performance. No make-up quizzes will be given.C. HomeworkHomework assignments will be submitted on the Web using MyLabsPlus.  The due dates are listed on the Web site. Typically about 15-20 problems will be assigned per chapter for a total of approximately 150 questions for the semester.  Each assignment will carry equal weight.  The instructions for logging in are available on BlackBoard Learn. Each assignment carry equal weight.
