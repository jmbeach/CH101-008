C = 2s^2 2px^1 2py^1 2pz^0 would predict two or three bonds that are 90° apart, rather than four bonds that are 109.5° apart.        To adjust for these inconsistencies, it was postulatedthat the valence atomic orbitals could hybridize beforebonding took place.          One hybridization of C is to mix all the 2s and 2p orbitals to get four orbitals that point at the corners of a tetrahedron.      Hybridization  Audio 0:02:36.629512  Some atoms hybridize their orbitals to maximize bonding.          More bonds = more full orbitals = more stability        Hybridizing is mixing different types of orbitals in the valence shell to make a new set of degenerate orbitals.          sp, sp2 , sp3 , sp3d, sp3d2                  Four Hybrid orbitals                      The same type of atom can have different types ofhybridization.          C = sp, sp2 , sp3                  If we need a trigonal planar                  Hybridize s and sp2                    Hybrid Orbitals  Audio 0:04:49.597515  The number of standard atomic orbitals combined = the number of hybrid orbitals formed.          Example for carbon:                  Combining a 2s with a 3p gives four sp3 hybrid orbitals.                    H cannot hybridize.                  Its valence shell only has one orbital.                                        Audio 0:05:51.042164                                            The number and type of standard atomic orbitals combined determines the shape of the hybrid orbitals.      The particular kind of hybridization that occurs is the one that yields the lowest overall energy for the molecule.

Either standard atomic orbitals or hybrids                  s to s, p to p, hybrid to hybrid, s to hybrid, etc.                      A pi (π) bond results when the bonding atomic orbitals are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis connecting the two bonding nuclei.          Between unhybridized parallel p orbitals        The interaction between parallel orbitals is not as strong as between orbitals that point at each other; therefore, σ bonds are stronger than π bonds.Bond Rotation  Audio 0:26:21.602225  Because of the orbitals that form the σ bond point along the internuclear axis, rotation around that bond does not require breaking the interaction between the orbitals.  But the orbitals that form the π bond interact above and below the internuclear axis, so rotation around the axis requires the breaking of the interaction between the orbitals.            With a single bond, you have free rotation of the molecule around the bond                  The rotation does not impact the strength of the bond                    With a double bond, you’d have to break the bond to rotate                  It actually freezes the structure of the molecule                    Cis &amp; Trans Isomers of 1,2-Dichloroethane  Audio 0:28:53.696722            Same compound, different properties      Think about trans-fats                  Still fat, but way more harmful                    Clicker 2  Audio 0:32:21.778478  place the following in order of decreasing dipole momentI. cis-CHCl=CHCl II. trans-CHCl=CHCl III. cis-CHF=CHFA) III &gt; I &gt; IIB) II &gt; I &gt; IIIC) I &gt; III &gt; IID) II &gt; III &gt; IE) I = III &gt; IIA.

The estimated solution is evaluated and adjusted until the energy of the orbital is minimized.                      In this treatment, the electrons belong to the wholemolecule, so the orbitals belong to the whole molecule.

The total number of MOs formed from a particular set of AOs always equals the number of AOs in the set.        When two AOs combine to form two MOs, one MO is lower in energy (the bonding MO) and the other is higher in energy (the antibonding MO).  When assigning the electrons of a molecule to MOs, we fill the lowest energy MOs first with a maximum of two spin-paired electrons per orbital.  When assigning electrons to two MOs of the same energy, Hund’s rule is followed to fill the orbitals singly first, with parallel spins, before pairing.  The bond order in a diatomic molecule is the number of electrons in bonding MOs minus the number in antibonding MOs divided by two.          Stable bonds require a positive bond order (more electrons in bonding MOs than in antibonding MOs).        MOs are named by type: σ, π, with a subscript to indicate what AOs they were formed from.Practice Problem on Bond Order H2-Period Two Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules  Interaction of p Orbitals    Molecular Orbital Energy Ordering  Practice Problem on Molecular Orbital Theory N2- ion.

When the combining atomic orbitals are different types and energies, contributions to the MOs are different:  The more electronegative an atom is, the lower in energy are its orbitals.  Lower energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the bonding MOs.  Higher energy atomic orbitals contribute more to the antibonding MOs.  Nonbonding MOs remain localized on the atom donating its atomic orbitals.Second-Period Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecules  Practice Problem on Molecular Orbital Theory CN-MO and Polyatomic Molecules  When many atoms are combined together, the atomicorbitals of all the atoms are combined to make a set ofmolecular orbitals, which are delocalized over the entiremolecule.

Both sets bonding electrons are pulled toward the O end of themolecule equally because O is more electronegative (EN) than theH atom.  Because of its geometry, the lone pairs do not negate the dipolemoment that result from the each of the O–H bonds.  The net result is a polar molecule.

Vector Addition: One Dimension  One Dimension:  To add two vectors that lie on the same line, assign one direction as positive.  Vectors pointing in that direction have positive magnitudes.  Consider vectors pointing in the opposite direction to have negative magnitudes.    Audio 0:09:58.418088  Just draw the first. Draw the second where the first ends and then calculate the net result.Vector Addition: Two or More Dimensions  Audio 0:10:34.308430Two or More Dimensions:  To add two vectors, draw a parallelogram in which the two vectors form two adjacent sides.  Draw the other two sides of the parallelogram parallel to and the same length as the two original vectors.  Draw the resultant vector beginning at the origin and extending to the far corner of the parallelogram as shown in Examples 4 and 5.  To add three or more vectors, add two of them together first, and then add the third vector to the result (Examples 6 and 7).  Molecular Polarity Affects Solubility in Water  Audio 0:13:22.721754  Polar molecules are attracted to other polar molecules.  Water is a polar molecule; therefore:          Other polar molecules will dissolve in water.      As well as ionic compounds        Some molecules have both polar and nonpolar parts.          Example: Soap molecule        Summarizing Determining Molecular Shape and Polarity  Audio 0:14:38.522158  Draw the Lewis structure for the molecule and determine itsmolecular geometry.  Determine if the molecule contains polar bonds.          A bond is polar if the two bonding atoms have sufficiently different electro negativities.      If the molecule contains polar bonds, superimpose a vector, pointing toward the more electronegative atom, on each bond.      Make the length of the vector proportional to the electronegativity difference between the bonding atoms.        Determine if the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole moment.          Sum the vectors corresponding to the polar bonds together. If the vectors sum to zero, the molecule is nonpolar.      If the vectors sum to a net vector, the molecule is polar      Practice Problem: Is a Molecule Polar?  Audio 0:15:19.845473  Is NH3 polar?

Paramagnetic material has unpaired electrons.  Lewis theory does not predict this result.  Problems with Lewis Theory  Audio 0:26:13.153424  Lewis theory generally predicts trends in properties, but it does not give good numerical predictions.          Example: bond strength and bond length        Lewis theory gives good first approximations of the bond angles in molecules, but it usually cannot be used to get the actual angle.  Resonance: Lewis theory cannot write one correctstructure for many molecules, and multiple resonancestructures is not “elegant”.  Lewis theory often does not predict the correct magnetic behavior of molecules.          For example, O2 is paramagnetic, although the Lewis structure predicts it is diamagnetic.

The orbitals can be the standard s, p, d, and f orbitals, or they may be hybrid combinations of these.  A chemical bond results from the overlap of two half-filled orbitals and spin-pairing of the two valence electrons (or less commonly the overlap of a completely filled orbital with an empty orbital).  The geometry of the overlapping orbitals determines the shape of the molecule.Valence Bond Theory: Main Concepts  The valence electrons of the atoms in a molecule reside in quantum-mechanical atomic orbitals. The orbitals can be the standard s, p, d, and f orbitals, or they may be hybrid combinations of these.  A chemical bond results when these atomic orbitalsinteract and there is a total of two electrons in the newmolecular orbital. a) The electrons must be spin paired.  The shape of the molecule is determined by the geometry of the interacting orbitals."

The structure includes many factors:          The skeletal arrangement of the atoms      The kind of bonding between the atoms        Ionic, polar covalent, or covalent  The shape of the molecule  Bonding theory predicts the shapes of molecules.What is Molecular Geometry?  Audio 0:08:43.125118  Molecules are three-dimensional objects.  Molecular geometries:          Describe the shape of a molecule with terms that relate to geometric figures      Have characteristic “corners” that indicate the positions of the surrounding atoms around a central atom in the center of the geometric figure        Have characteristic angles that are called bond anglesLewis Theory  Audio 0:09:38.911219  Lewis theory predicts there are regions of electron density in an atom. +  These regions of electron density should repel each otherbecause the regions are negatively charged.          Some regions result from placing shared pairs of valence electrons between bonding nuclei.        Other regions result from placing unshared valence electrons on a single nuclei.  These regions are called “electron groups”  Audio 0:10:23.928591  This idea can then be extended to predict the shapes of the molecules.          The position of atoms surrounding a central atom will be determined by where the bonding electron groups are.      The positions of the electron groups will be determined by trying to minimize repulsions between them.      VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) Theory  Audio 0:10:57.562360  Electron groups around the central atom will be most stable when they are as far apart as possible.          This is the basis for VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) theory.      Because electrons are negatively charged, they should be most stable when they are separated as much as possible.        The resulting geometric arrangement will allow us to predict the shapes and bond angles in the molecule.  Electron Groups  Audio 0:11:58.852503  The Lewis structure predicts the number of valenceelectron pairs around the central atoms.  Each lone pair of electrons constitutes one electron groupon a central atom.  Each bond constitutes one electron group on a centralatom, regardless of whether it is single, double, or triple.  Example: NO2            There are three electron groups on N:                  Three lone pairs          One single bond          One double bond                    Electron Group Geometry  Audio 0:12:41.207985  There are five basic arrangements of electron groups around acentral atom.          Arrangements are as follows:        Linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, bipyramidal, and octahedral  Based on a maximum of six bonding electron groups          Though there may be more than six on very large atoms, it is very rare.        Each of these five basic arrangements results in five different basicelectron geometries.          In order for the molecular shape and bond angles to be a “perfect” geometric figure, all the electron groups must be bonds and all the bonds must be equivalent.        For molecules that exhibit resonance, it doesn’t matter which resonance form you use as the electron geometry will be the sameValence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) model:  Audio 0:14:33.045667| Class | # of atoms bonded to central atom | # lone pairs on central atom | arrangements of electron groups | molecular geometry || — | — | — | — | — || AB2 | 2 | 0 |  |  |Beryllium Chloride  Audio 0:15:20.954184            Beryllium has two valence electrons      Linear molecule      Carbon dioxide            Double bonds but still linear      VSEPR says the Oxygens want to be as far away from each-other as possible      VSEPR  Audio 0:16:30.584774            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar       trigonal planar         To minimize electron repulsion, the atoms form a trigonal planar (or are 120 degrees angled from each-other)Boron Trifluoride  Audio 0:17:18.718797  More complicated  VSEPR  Audio 0:19:31.975550            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar      trigonal planar              AB4      4      0      tetrahedral       tetrahedral         tetrahedral is most common  VSEPR (trigonal)  Audio 0:21:35.070764            Class      # of atoms bonded to central atom      # lone pairs on central atom      arrangement of electron groups      molecular geometry                  AB2      2      0      linear      linear              AB3      3      0      trigonal planar      trigonal planar              AB4      4      0      tetrahedral      tetrahedral              AB5      5      0      trigonal bipyramidal       trigonal bipyramidal       Phosphorus PentachlorideFive Electron Groups: Trigonal Bipyramidal  Audio 0:23:20.082880Electron Geometry  When there are five electron groups around the central atom, they will occupypositions in the shape of two tetrahedral that are base to base with the centralatom in the center of the shared bases.

When the electron groups are attached to atoms of different size,or when the bonding to one atom is different from the bonding toanother, this will affect the molecular geometry around the centralatom.  Lone pairs affect the molecular geometry.

Practice Problem Assigning Formal Charges  Audio 0:12:40.335303  OCN-  Rules of Resonance Structures  Audio 0:19:11.165662  Resonance structures must have the same connectivity.          Only electron positions can change.        Resonance structures must have the same number of electrons.  Second row elements have a maximum of eight electrons.          Bonding and nonbonding      Third row can have expanded octet        Formal charges must total the same.          Better structures have fewer formal charges.

The change in energy for a reaction can beestimated by comparing the cost of breaking oldbonds to the energy released from making newbonds.  The amount of energy, in the gaseous state, that ittakes to break one mole of a bond in a compound is called the bond energy.  Audio 0:34:03.982413  The energy change required to break a particular bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is the bond energy  Trends in Bond Energies  Audio 0:36:20.771621  In general, the more electrons two atoms share, thestronger the covalent bond.

Single bond &lt; Double bond &lt; Triple bond      Lewis theory would predict that double bonds are twice as strong as single bonds, but the reality is they are less than twice as strong.        Bond strength is measured by how much energy must beadded into the bond to break it in half.Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality for Bond Length  Audio 0:40:57.263317  Lewis theory predicts that the more electrons two atoms share, the shorter the bond should be.          When comparing bonds to like atoms        Bond length is determined by measuring the distance between the nuclei of bonded atoms.  In general, triple bonds are shorter than double bonds, and double bonds are shorter than single bonds.  Bond Lengths  Audio 0:42:20.387950  The distance between the nuclei of bonded atoms iscalled the bond length.

One atom pulls the electrons in the bond closer toits side.      One end of the bond has larger electron density thanthe other.        The result is a polar covalent bond.          Bond polarity      The end with the larger electron density gets a partialnegative charge.      The end that is electron deficient gets a partial positive charge.

A dipole is a material with a + and − end.      It is directly proportional to the size of the partial charges (q) and directly proportional to the distance (r) between them.                  µ (dipole moment) = (q)(r)                    Measured in Debyes, D        Generally, the more electrons two atoms share and the larger the atoms are, the larger the dipole moment.  Electronegativity Difference and Bond Type  Audio 0:13:12.370573  If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is 0, the bond is pure covalent.          Equal sharing of the atoms in the bond      If the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0.1 to 0.4, the bond is nonpolar covalent.        If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is 0.5 to 1.9, the bond is polar covalent.          Unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms inthe bond        If the difference in electronegativity between bondedatoms is larger than or equal to 2.0, the bond is ionic.Percent Ionic Character  Audio 0:15:43.076694  The percent ionic character is the percentage of a bond’s measured dipole moment compared to what it would be if the electrons were completely transferred.  The percent ionic character indicates the degree to which the electron is transferred.

The less electronegative atom in the molecule is usually the center atom.                  Simple molecules have a “center” atom to which all of the other atoms in the molecules are attached (bonded) to.                          For example, for CO2, the center atom is C, so both O atoms are attached to the carbon atom.                                  Audio 0:18:55.177204                  O–C–O                                                                        The more electronegative atoms are usually terminal (attached to the center atom).                  Hydrogen atoms are always in the terminal position.                      Determine the total number of valence electrons each atom brings to form themolecule.          Examples:                  For the molecule H–Br: H atom brings 1 electron and Br atoms brings 7 electrons for a total 8 electrons          In polyatomic ions, the charge on the ion also must be accounted. For the polyatomic ion NO2 –, a total of 18 electrons are brought in: 5 electrons from N, total 12 from O (2 oxygen atoms × 2), and 2 from the 2+ charge.                    Writing Lewis Structures for Molecular Compounds  Audio 0:20:36.268038  Distribute the electrons among the atoms in the molecule giving octets (or duets in the case of hydrogen) to as many atoms as possible.          The best practice is to place two electrons around an atom at a time.                  Bonding pairs: electrons between two atoms          Nonbonding or lone pairs: electrons not participating in bonding but complete the atom’s “octet”                    The total number of electrons brought in must be accounted for in the Lewis structure and must not violate any criteria (i.e., H atoms can only have single bonds or two electrons total).        If any atoms lack an octet, form double or triple bonds as necessary to givethem octets.          Atoms that can multiple bond with each other or to themselves are as follows:                  Double bond (4 electrons or two pairs of electrons between atoms): C, O, N, S, &amp; P          Triple bond (6 electrons or three pairs of electrons between atoms): C,O, N, &amp; S                    Practice Problem Writing Lewis Structures for Polyatomic IonsNH4+  Audio 0:23:57.666020  O3  Resonance and Formal Charges  Audio 0:31:22.898676  Two additional concepts to write the bestpossible Lewis structures for a large numberof compounds  The concepts are:          Resonance, used when two or more valid Lewis structures can be drawn for the same compound      Formal charge, an electron bookkeeping system that allows us to discriminate between alternative Lewis structures      Resonance  Audio 0:32:45.308690  Lewis theory localizes the electrons between the atoms that are bondingtogether.  Extensions of Lewis theory suggest that there is some degree ofdelocalization of the electrons; the concept is called resonance.          Delocalization of charge helps to stabilize the molecule.        When there is more than one Lewis structure for a molecule that differ only in the position of the electrons, they are called resonance structures.          The actual molecule is a combination of the resonance forms—a resonance hybrid.      The molecule does not resonate between the two forms, though we often draw it that way.                  Example: O3 molecule                          Resonance hybrid: Just as the offspring of two different dog breeds is a hybrid that is intermediate between the two breeds (a), the structure of a resonance hybrid is intermediate between that of the contributing resonance structures (b).Ex  Audio 0:38:19.039491  Clicker  Audio 0:38:59.721909    Draw the Lewis structure for CO3^2- including any valid resonance structures.          two single bonds and one double bond      Formal Charge  Audio 0:42:50.124155  Are all Resonance Structures equally good?

The electron affinity of the nonmetal is exothermic.                  Generally, the ionization energy of the metal is larger than the electron affinity of the nonmetal; therefore, the formation of the ionic compound should be endothermic.  But the heat of formation of most ionic compounds is exothermic and generally large.

Ionic solids are relatively hard compared to most molecular solids.                  If you’ve ever touched a crystal, this is obvious                      implies that if the ions are displaced from their position in the crystal lattice, repulsive forces should occur.          this predicts that the crystal will become unstable and break apart. Theory predicts that ionic solids will be brittle.                  If you strike a crystal with a hammer, it will shatter because it becomes unstable                          The same is not true for metals                                Ionic solids are brittle.

Conductivity of NaCl  Audio 0:14:19.003024  In NaCl(s), the ions are stuck in position and not able to move to the charged rods.                  In NaCl(aq), the ions are separated and are able to move to the charged rods.                Ionic Bonding and the Crystal Lattice  Audio 0:14:34.266075  The extra energy that is released comes from the formation of a structure in which every cation is surrounded by anions and vice versa.          This structure is called a crystal lattice.        The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions.          Electrostatic attraction is a nondirectional force.                  Therefore, there is no ionic molecule.                          The chemical formula is an empirical formula, simply giving the ratio of ions based on charge balance.                                            The crystal lattice maximizes the attractions between cations and anions leading to the most stable arrangementIonic Compounds  Audio 0:16:15.553827  Ionic compounds are composed of cations (metals) and anions (nonmetals) bound together by ionic bonds.          Examples of ionic compounds:                  NaBr, Al2(CO3)3, CaHPO4, and MgSO4                      The basic unit of an ionic compound is the formula unit, the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions.          Example:                  The ionic compound table salt, with the formula unit NaCl, is composed of Na+ and Cl+ions in a one-to-one ratio.                      Summarizing Ionic Compound Formulas          Ionic compounds always contain positive and negative ions.      In a chemical formula, the sum of the charges of the positive ions (cations) must equal the sum of the charges of the negative ions (anions).      The formula of an ionic compound reflects the smallest whole-number ratio of ions.

The first type contains a metal whose charge is invariant from one compound to another.  Whenever the metal in this first type of compound forms an ion, the ion always has the same charge.

The names of binary ionic compounds take the following form:  For example, the name for KCl consists of the name of the cation, potassium, followed by the base name of the anion, chlor, with the ending -ide.          KCl is potassium chloride.                  We know potasium is +1, we know Cl is -1, so we don’t have to write it                      The name for CaO consists of the name of the cation, calcium,followed by the base name of the anion, ox, with the ending -ide.          CaO is calcium oxide.

Lewis electron-dot structures (Lewis structures) depict the structural formula with its valence electrons.  Audio 0:27:52.445649  Lewis structures focus on valence electrons because chemical bonding involves the transfer or sharing of valence electrons between two or more atoms.Octet Rule: A Guideline for Molecule Formation  Audio 0:28:08.406107  When atoms bond, they tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to give a noble gas–like configuration.          ns2np6        Nonmetals: period 2 elements must obey the octet rule (i.e., eight valence electrons around each atom in the molecule).  Exceptions to the octet rule: Expanded octets          (Sometimes octet rule doesn’t work)      Audio 0:29:09.248458      They involve the nonmetal elements located in period 3 and below.      Nonmetals (period 3 on down in the periodic table) follow the octet rule when they are not the center atom.                  The center atom is the atom in the molecule that the other elements individually bond (attach) to.                    When they are the center atom, they can accommodate more than eight electrons.        Using empty valence d orbitals that are predicted by quantum theoryMultivalent Metals: Naming Type II Ionic Compounds  Audio 0:30:05.304852  The metals in this category tend to have multiple charges (i.e., multivalent cations):  Their charge cannot be predicted as in the case of most representative elements and must be noted in their name.  Transition and inner transition metals          Iron (Fe) forms a 2+ cation in some of its compounds and a 3+ cation in others.                  FeSO4: Here iron is a +2 cation (Fe2+).          Fe2(SO4)3: Here iron is a +3 cation (Fe3+).                      Many of the p-block metals          Not all p-block metals are multivalent.      Some main-group metals, such as Pb, Tl, and Sn, form more than one type of cation.      Type II Cation  Audio 0:31:26.941062  Naming Type II Binary Ionic Compounds— Example: CrBr3  Audio 0:32:36.900613  To name CrBr_3, cation + total anion charge = 0          Cr charge + 3(Br+charge) = 0      Since each Br has a –1 charge, then                  Cr charge + 3(–1) = 0          Cr charge + (–3) = 0          Cr = +3                    Hence, the cation Cr3+ is called chromium(III), and Br^- is called bromide.        The name for CrBr3 is chromium(III) bromide.Polyatomic Ions  Audio 0:33:44.947274Oxyanions  Audio 0:34:09.654184  Most polyatomic ions are oxyanions, anions containing oxygen and another element.  Noticethatwhenaseriesofoxyanionscontainsdifferent numbers of oxygen atoms, the oxyanions are named according to the number of oxygen atoms in the ion.  Iftherearetwoionsintheseries,          the one with more oxygen atoms has the ending -ate; and+the one with fewer has the ending -ite.        Forexample,          NO3+is nitrate SO_4^2+ is sulfate      NO2+is nitrite SO_3^2+ is sulfite        If there are more than two ions in the series, then the prefixes hypo-, meaning less than, and per-,meaning more than, are used.                Naming Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions  Audio 0:36:49.401712  Ionic compounds that contain a polyatomic ion rather than a simple anion (e.g., Cl–) are named in the same manner as binary ionic compounds, except that the name of the polyatomic ion used.          For example, NaNO2 is named according to                  its cation, Na+, sodium; and          its polyatomic anion, NO2–, nitrite.                    Hence, NaNO2 is sodium nitrite.

That will tell you where it has a stable configuration (eight electrons). Since the sixth ionization energy is the highest, we can conclude that this is where we reach a stable configuration. Since we are told that our element is on the third period (row), we know that every time we remove an electron, we are going to the left across the periodic table, so we are moving towards neon.

M(g)+1e− →M1−(g)+EA                      It is defined as exothermic (−) the release of energy. Butmay actually be endothermic (+) taking energy.          Some alkali earth metals’ and all noble gases’ electron affinities are endothermic.        The more energy that is released, the larger the electron affinity.          The more negative the number, the larger the EA.      Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA)  Audio 0:08:45.799510  General Trend for Main-Group Elements          EA increases across a period.                  EA becomes more negative from left to right.                      Halogens have the highest EA for any period  Periodic Trend: Electron Affinities (EA) for Main-Group Elements  Audio 0:10:58.796812  Summarizing Electron Affinity for Main-Group Elements          Most groups (columns) of the periodic table do not exhibit any definite trend in electron affinity.        Among the group 1A metals, however, electron affinity becomes more positive as we move down the column (adding an electron becomes less exothermic).          Alkali metals (group 1A) decrease electron affinity down the column.        Generally irregular increase in EA from second period to third period          Group 5A generally has lower EA than expected because extra electron must pair up.      Groups 2A and 8A generally have very low EA because added electron goes into higher energy level or sublevel.        Electron affinity generally becomes more negative (adding an electron becomes more exothermic) as we move to the right across a period (row) in the periodic table.Characteristics of Metals versus Nonmetals  Audio 0:12:24.155206            Metals      Nonmetals                  malleable and ductile      brittle in solid State              shiny      dull              conduct heat and electricity      insulator              basic      acidic              form cations      form anions              lose electrons in reactions      gain electrons in reactions      Periodic Trend: Metallic Character  Audio 0:15:52.518767  Periodic Trend: Metallic Character  Metallic character is how closely an element’s properties match the ideal properties of a metal          More malleable and ductile, better conductor, and easier to ionize        Metallic character decreases left to right across a periodthe right  Metallic character increases down the column.

Electron affinity decreases down the column.  metals generally have smaller first ionization energies and nonmetals generally have larger electron affinities.  Audio 0:18:19.520679  Metallic Elements:  Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atom’s metallic character should          increase down a column because the valence electrons are not held as strongly;      decrease across a period because the valence electrons are held more strongly and the electron affinity increases.        Atomic radius increases down the column.  Melting point decreases down the column.          MP for metals are generally low        Density increases down the column.

The molecular compound of water, H2O                      Molecules are compounds.  The great diversity of substances that we find in nature is a direct result of the ability of elements to form many different compounds.Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Water  Audio 0:21:35.856576  The dramatic difference between the elements hydrogen and oxygen and the compound water is typical of the differences between elements and the compounds that they form.

The electron affinity of the nonmetal is exothermic.    Generally, the ionization energy of the metal is larger than the electron affinity of the nonmetal; therefore, the formation of the ionic compound should be endothermic.

Except for He, which has only two electrons        They are especially nonreactive.          He and Ne are practically inert.        The reason the noble gases are so nonreactive is that the electron configuration of the noble gases is especially stable.Electron Configuration and Ion Formation  Audio 0:15:50.407566  Ion formation can be predicted by an element’s location in the periodic table.  These atoms form ions that will result in an electron configuration that is the same as that of the nearest noble gas.  Metals form cations (positively charged atoms).          Alkali metals (group 1A) form only +1 cations.      Alkaline earth metals (group 2A) form only +2 cations.      Transition, inner transition, and p-block metals form a variety of charged cations.        Nonmetals form anions (negatively charged atoms).  Halogens (group 7A) usually gain one electron to form –1 anions.          Other nonmetals can form a variety of charged anions.      Electron Configuration and Ion Formation: Elements that Form Ions with Predictable Charges  Effective Nuclear Charge and the Screening Effect  Audio 0:17:40.420403            Nuclear charge minus core electrons      Effective Nuclear Charge  Audio 0:18:34.927551  The effective nuclear charge is a net positive charge that is attracting a particular electron.  Core electrons efficiently shield electrons in the outermost principal energy level from nuclear charge.  Outermost electrons in the valence shell do not efficiently shield one another from nuclear charge.  Z is the nuclear charge, and S is the number of electrons in lower energy levels.          Electrons in the same energy level contribute to screening, but since their contribution is so small, they are not part of the calculation.        Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge  Audio 0:20:20.485159  There are several methods for measuring the radius of an atom,and they give slightly different numbers.  Van der Waals radius = nonbonding  Covalent radius = bonding radius  Atomic radius is an average radius of an atom based on measuring large numbers of compounds.  Periodic Trends: Atomic Radii and Effective Nuclear Charge  Audio 0:21:45.986365  Atomic radius decreases across a period (left to right). –  Adding electrons to the same valence shell          Effective nuclear charge increases.      Valence shell held closer        Atomic radius increases down a group.          Valence shell farther from nucleus      Effective nuclear charge fairly constant (expansionmostly due to increasing n)            Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements  Audio 0:25:24.843667  The size of an atom is related to the distance the valence electrons are from the nucleus.          The larger the orbital an electron is in, the farther its most probable distance will be from the nucleus, and the less attraction it will have for the nucleus.      Traversing down a group adds a principal energy level, and the larger the principal energy level an orbital is in, the larger its volume.      Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get larger down a column.      Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Main- Group Elements  Audio 0:26:14.499563  The larger the effective nuclear charge an electron experiences, the stronger the attraction it will have for the nucleus.          The closer their average distance will be to the nucleus, the stronger the attraction the valence electrons have for the nucleus.      Traversing across a period increases the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons.      Quantum-mechanics predicts that the atoms should get smaller across a period.      Summarizing Atomic Radii Trend for Transition Elements  Audio 0:26:56.496332  Atoms in the same group increase in size down the column.  Atomic radii of transition metals are roughly the same size across the d block.          Much less difference than across main group elements      Valence shell ns2, not the (n − 1)d electrons      Effective nuclear charge on the ns2 electrons approximately the same      Ions: Magnetic Properties  Audio 0:27:41.873967  Electron configurations that result in unpaired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have a net magnetic field; this is calledparamagnetism.          Will be attracted to a magnetic field          Electron configurations that result in all paired electrons mean that the atom or ion will have no magnetic field; this is calleddiamagnetism.          Slightly repelled by a magnetic field        Radii of Atoms and Their Ions: Cations  Audio 0:30:05.119746  Cation radius is smaller than its corresponding atom radius.          Loose electrons experiencing small effective nuclear charge; remaining electrons those experiencing a larger effective nuclear charge        Traversing down a group increases the (n − 1) level, causing the cations to get larger.  Traversing to the right across a period increases the effective nuclear charge for isoelectronic cations, causing the cations to get smaller.    Audio 0:32:15.588321  isoelectronic = same number of electronsRadii of Atoms and Their Ions: Anions  Audio 0:32:32.478937  When atoms form anions, electrons are added to the valence shell.  Addition of electrons increases repulsion in valence shell without compensating increase in effective nuclear charge  The result is that the anion is larger than the atom. Traversing down a group increases the n level, causing the anions to get larger.  Traversing to the left across a period decreases the effective nuclear charge for isoelectronic anions, causing the anions to get larger.    oposite of what happens with cationsClicker 2  Place the following in order of increasing radius          Br-, Na+, Rb+      Na+, Rb+, Br-      Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)  Audio 0:37:37.889283  Ionization Energy (IE):  It is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or ion in the gas phase.

The farther the most probable distance the electron is from the nucleus, the less energy it takes to remove it.  Trend:          First IE decreases down the group.        Valence electron is farther from nucleus.          First IE generally increases across the period. + Effective nuclear charge increases.      Periodic Trend: Ionization Energy (Potential)  Audio 0:40:54.665440          Audio 0:42:14.239301            Nitrogen has three unpaired electrons, the next electron has to go down an orbital which will make it a little easier to remove the last electron in oxygen to get to nitrogen.      First Ionization Energy: Exceptions to the Trend  Audio 0:43:42.531942  GENERAL trend for first ionization energy of main-group elements is that as you go across a period, ionization energy increases.          Exceptions: 2A to 3A and 5A to 6A        Exceptions are usually a result of          the type of orbital (s, p, d, or f) and its shielding ability;      repulsion factors associated with electrons occupying degenerate orbitals (i.e., p orbitals).        B has smaller first ionization energy than Be due to electron position: 2p for B and 2s for Be.The electron in 2p orbitals has more shielding (i.e., lower effective nuclear charge) and therefore requires less energy for its removal than an electron in a 2s orbital.  Trends of Second and Successive Ionization Energies  Audio 0:44:46.840846  They depend on the number of valence electrons an element has.–  ionization energies increase dramatically in going from valence to core electrons  Removal of each successive electron costs more energy.–  Shrinkage in size due to having more protons than electrons–  Outer electrons closer to the nucleus; therefore harder to remove  There’s a regular increase in energy for each successive valence electron.

Orbitals fill in the following order:                  1s2s2p3s3p4s3d4p5s4d5p6s.                      Orbitals can hold no more than two electrons each. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, their spins are opposite.

He found that when elements were listed in order of increasing mass, these similar properties recurred in a periodic pattern.  To be periodic means to exhibit a repeating pattern.The Periodic Law  Audio 0:26:52.707876  Mendeleev summarized these observations in the periodic law:          When the elements are arranged in order of increasing mass, certain sets of properties recur periodically.        Note: Mendeleev ignored some of data, e.g. atomic mass of Te &gt; atomic mass of lMendeleev’s Periodic Table  Audio 0:28:14.871013  Mendeleev’s periodic table          organized known elements of the time in a table format.                  He arranged the rows so that elements with similar properties would fall in the same vertical columns.                    contained some gaps, which allowed him to predict the existence (and even the properties) of yet undiscovered elements.                  Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element he called eka-silicon.                          The Modern Periodic Table: Its Format  Audio 0:29:46.955888  The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number rather than increasing relative mass as they were in Mendeleev’s periodic table.                  Rows of the table are referred to as periods (or just plain rows).  Columns in the table are referred to as groups or a family.          Elements in a group or family have similar properties.      NOTE: Mendeleev’s periodic law predicts pattern but does NOT explain why the patterns or similarity in properties occurs.

The period number corresponds to the principal energy level of the valence electrons.                Orbital blocks and their position in the periodic table  Transition and Inner Transition Metals  Audio 0:34:11.820224  Transition metals (d block) and inner transition metals (f block) exhibit trends differing from those of main-group elements (s block and p block).          Because of sublevel splitting, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel; therefore, the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital.      The difference in energy is not large.        Some of the transition metals have irregular electron configurations in which the ns only partially fills before the (n − 1)d or doesn’t fill at all.          Therefore, their electron configuration must be found experimentally.

Elements in the same column have similar properties.      The elements in a period show a pattern that repeats.

For like charges, the potential energy (E) is positive and decreases as the particles get farther apart as r increases.      For opposite charges, the potential energy is negative and becomes more negative as the particles get closer together.      The strength of the interaction increases as the size of the charges increases.                  Electrons are more strongly attracted to a nucleus with a 2+ charge than to a nucleus with a 1+ charge.

What the question is asking you to do is identify a pair of isotopes of the same element. One must understand that all variations of an element (even the most common) is an isotope. A pair of isotopes would be of the same element (meaning same atomic number / number of protons). The only options with the same atomic numbers are A and C which have an atomic number of 21.

We look at the periodic table and find that the element with atomic number 12 is magnesium (Mg). However, this is not the end of the problem. Neutrons do not affect the answer because the answers do not show isotopes, but electrons (e-) do affect the answer because some of the answers show a non-neutral charge. Because p+ = 12 and e- = 10, there are more positive charges than negative charges in the atom, making the overall charge 2+ (two more protons than neutrons). Therefore, the complete answer is Mg^2+    How many significant figures are there in the answer for the following problem?          34.2 + 0.6699 + 18?       one       two       three       four                With addition and subtraction, the accuracy of the final answer can be no greater than the least accurate measurement. Because 18 is the least precise, the final answer will have only have no precision past the decimal making the number of significant digits 2 (answer would be 53)    How many atoms of oxygen are in 2.50 moles of SO_2?           4.52 * 10^24       1.51 * 10^24       5.02 * 10^23       3.01 * 10^24       7.53 * 10^23                    Determine the velocity of a marble (m = 7.75 g) with a wavelength of 3.46 * 10^-33 m           40.5 m/s       2.47 m/s       24.7 m/s       38.8 m/s       52.9 m/s                    Calculate the mass (in g) of 2.0 * 10^24 atoms of Hg           3.9 * 10^2 g       2.4 * 10^2 g       3.2 * 10^2 g       1.5 * 10^2 g       6.5 * 10^2 g                    Determine the mass of an object that has a volume of 88.6 mL and a density of 7.77 g/mL.           96.4 g       0.0877 g       11.4 g       80.8 g       688 g            What species is represented by the following information?          p+ = 47, n° = 62, e- = 46       Ag+       Nd       Pd       Ag       Pd+              To identify which element this information represents, you must look at the atomic number or the number of protons (p+). p+ = 47. We look at the periodic table and find that the element with atomic number 47 is silver (Ag). However, this is not the end of the problem. Neutrons do not affect the answer because the answers do not show isotopes, but electrons (e-) do affect the answer because some of the answers show a non-neutral charge. Because p+ = 12 and e- = 10, there are more positive charges than negative charges in the atom, making the overall charge 2+ (two more protons than neutrons).

Must approximate its solution for multi- electron systems.          Our approximations though are good enough to work in practical application      Horizon made it to Pluto for example      Quantum Numbers: The Solutions from the Wave Function, ψ  Audio 0:12:06.144429  Calculations show that the size, shape, and orientation in space of an orbital are determined by three integer terms in the wave function.          Quantize the energy of the electron        These integers (solutions) are called quantum numbers.          There are four quantum numbers:                  Principal quantum number,n                          Energy level                                          Angular momentum quantum number, l                  Orbital type                      Magnetic quantum number, ml          Audio 0:14:21.378733      Position of orbital in an X-Y-Z plot        Spin quantum number, ms          Orientation of the spin of the electron        These quantum numbers control how electrons are distributed in an atomPrincipal Quantum Number, n: The Energy Level  Audio 0:15:13.929935  It characterizes the energy of the electron in a particular orbital.          It is Bohr’s energy level.        Values of n can be any whole number integer &gt;= 1.  It determines the size (overall) and energy of an orbital.  The larger the value of n, the more energy the orbital has.  The larger the value of n, the larger the orbital.  Audio 0:17:10.934989  Energies are defined as being “negative.”          An electron’s energy is lowered (made more negative) as a result of its interaction with the nucleus of the atom.                  An electron would have E = 0 when it escapes the atom.                    As n gets larger, the following occurs:                  The amount of energy between orbitals gets smaller.          The energy of the orbital becomes greater (less negative).

Ex n = 1                          Only l=0 is allowed                                n = 2                          l = 0 or l = 1 are allowed                                            Each value of l is designated by a particular letter thatdesignates the shape of the orbital.          s orbitals are spherical.      p orbitals are like two balloons tied at the knots (dumbbell shape).      d orbitals are mainly like four balloons tied at the knots.      f orbitals are mainly like eight balloons tied at the knots.      Magnetic Quantum Number, ml: The Position or Orientation Quantum Number  Audio 0:22:55.744076  The magnetic quantum number is an integer that specifies the orientation of the orbital.          The direction in space the orbital is aligned relative to the other orbitals        Values are integers from −l to +l.          Including zero      Gives the number of orbitals of a particular shape                  When l=2,the values of ml are−2,−1,0,+1,+2, which means there are five orbitals with l = 2.                    Describing an Orbital  Audio 0:24:11.173521  Each set of n, l, and ml describes one orbital.  Orbitals with the same value of n are in thesame principal energy level.          Also called the principal shell        Orbitals with the same values of n and l are said to be in the same sublevel.

Audio 0:29:26.973235  Each wavelength in the spectrum of an atom corresponds to an electron transition betweenorbitals.  When an electron is excited, it transitions from an orbital in a lower energy level to an orbital in a higher energy level.  When an electron relaxes, it transitions from an orbital in a higher energy level to an orbital in a lower energy level.  When an electron relaxes, a photon of light is released whose energy equals the energy difference between the orbitals.It Explains Electron Transitions  Audio 0:30:54.218927  To transition to a higher energy state, the electron must gain the correct amount of energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.  Electrons in high energy states are unstable and tend to lose energy and transition to lower energy states.  Each line in the emission spectrum corresponds to the difference in energy between two energy states.It Predicts the Spectrum of Hydrogen  Audio 0:31:35.930644• For an electron in an energy state n, there are (n–1) energy states it can transition to. Therefore, it can generate (n – 1) lines.Energy Transitions in Hydrogen  Audio 0:32:20.175336  The energy of a photon released is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels the electron is jumping between.  It can be calculated by subtracting the energy of the initial state from the energy of the final state.

Examples of Spectra  Audio 0:30:24.253251    Each element has its own emission spectrum  All of this points to atoms emitting and absorbing light / energy in discrete packetsThe Bohr Model of the Atom  Audio 0:31:23.054768  The nuclear model of the atom (Rutherford model) does not explain what structural changes occur when the atom gains or loses energy.          He hypothesized that only certain orbits are allowed and came up with a model which predicted what was observed        Bohr developed a model of the atom to explain how the structure of the atom changes when it undergoes energy transitions.  Bohr’s major idea was that the energy of the atom was quantized, and that the amount of energy in the atom was related to the electron’s position in the atom.          Quantized means that the atom could have only very specific amounts of energy.      Bohr’s Model  Audio 0:32:22.750198  The electrons travel in orbits that are at a fixed distance from the nucleus.          Found different shapes of orbits      Stationary states      Therefore, the energy of the electron was proportional to the distance the orbit was from the nucleus.        Electrons emit radiation when they “jump” from an orbit with higher energy down to an orbit with lower energy.          Audio 0:32:58.969212      The emitted radiation was a photon of light.      The distance between the orbits determined the energy of the photon of light produced.

Interference Types:          Constructive interference: waves that interact so that they make a larger wave are said to be in phase                                      Destructive interference: Waves that interact so that they cancel each other out are said to be out of phase                                      Two-Slit Interference  Audio 0:38:15.810042    Diffraction pattern          Either it goes through a slit or it doesn’t      Wave Behavior Properties: Diffraction  Audio 0:38:41.975443  When traveling waves encounter an obstacle or opening in a barrier that is about the same size as the wavelength, they bend around it; this is called diffraction.          Traveling particles do not diffract        The diffraction of light through two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wavelength results in an interference pattern of the diffracted waves.  An interference pattern is a characteristic of all light waves.  Wave Behavior of Electrons  Audio 0:39:38.320960  De Broglie proposed that particles could have wavelike character.  De Broglie predicted that the wavelength of a particle was inversely proportional to its momentum.  Because it is so small, the wave character of electrons is significant.

Chapter 3  Audio 0:18:47.526137Properties of Waves  Audio 0:19:09.721677    Wavelength (λ) is the distance between identical points on successive waves.  Amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline of a wave to the peak or trough.  Audio 0:20:20.914304    Frequency (ν) is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in 1 second (Hz = 1 cycle/s).  Audio 0:21:32.710413  The speed (v) of the wave = λ x νLight  Audio 0:23:42.023732  Amplitude and Wavelength  Audio 0:24:52.722734  Wavelength and amplitude are independent properties.          The wavelength of light determines its color (intensive physical property).        The amplitude, or intensity, determines its brightness (extensive physical property)          Brightness dependent on amplitude        Color  Audio 0:26:15.944132  The color of light is determined by its wavelength or frequency.  White light is a mixture of all the colors of visible light.          A spectrum      Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet        When an object absorbs some of the wavelengths of white light and reflects others, it appears colored; the observed color is predominantly the colors reflected.Maxwell  Audio 0:26:23.185612  Maxwell (1873), proposed that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves.  Electromagnetic Spectrum  Audio 0:29:13.853883  Example problem  Audio 0:30:56.499318  An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 6.0 x 10^4 Hz. Does this frequency fall in the visible region? Convert this frequency into wavelength (nm).                Clicker Question  Audio 0:34:13.178546  What is the wave length of a wave with frequency 8.6 * 10^13 Hz?  Einstein and the Photoelectronic Effect  Audio 0:39:00.844561  Hertz observed that when (some) light shines on a metal surface, electrons are produced from the surface.          The electrons emitted from the metal surface are photoelectrons.      This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect.              Audio 0:40:20.734175          Number of electrons depends upon light intensity      More Kinetic energy at higher frequency of light      Emission has a frequency threshold, below which there are no electrons        Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:05.218727  Classic theory explanation:          The photoelectric effect according to classic wave theory attributed the electrons’ being emitted from the metal surface to the light energy being transferred to the electrons.      Classic theory states the following:                  If the wavelength of light is made shorter or the light wave’sintensity is made brighter, more electrons should be ejected.          Energy of a wave is directly proportional to its amplitude and its frequency.                          Example: If a dim light is used there should be a lag time before electrons are emitted in order to give the electrons time to absorb enough energy.                                          Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Audio 0:42:13.093629  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Experimental observations indicate the following:                  A minimum frequency was needed before electrons would be emitted regardless of the intensity called the threshold frequency.          High-frequency light from a dim source caused electron emission without any lag time.                    Einstein’s idea: “Light Is Quantized.”  Audio 0:43:33.274758  Ejection of electrons from a metal surface by light:          One photon at the threshold frequency gives the electron just enough energy for it to escape the atom.      Binding energy, φ      When irradiated with a shorter wavelength photon, the electron absorbs more energy than is necessary to escape.      This excess energy becomes kinetic energy of the ejected electron.                                      Where (hυ) is a quantized packet of energy      Explaining the Photoelectric Effect  Einstein’s explanation: Quantum theory          Einstein proposed that the light energy was delivered to the atoms in packets called quanta or photons.                  Energy = (hυ)                          hυ = quanta                                          The energy of a photon of light is directly proportional to its frequency.                  E = hc/λ          Or it is inversely proportional to its wavelength.                    Symbols:                  Planck’s Constant, (h) is a proportionality constant with a value of h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s.

Ex: How many mL are in 1.63 L?  Ex: The speed of sound in air is about 343 m/s. What is this speed in miles per hour? (1 mile = 1.609 km)  Audio 0:20:52.486829  What is a Mole?  Audio 0:23:59.232240  A mole is a scientist’s “baker’s dozen.”          When we count large numbers of objects, we often use units such as                  1 dozen objects = 12 objects          1 gross objects = 144 objects.                      A mole (mol) of anything contains 6.02214 × 1023 pieces.          Examples:                  1 mol of marbles corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 marbles.          1 mol of sand grains corresponds to 6.02214 × 1023 sand grains.                      This number is Avogadro’s number.The Mole  Audio 0:26:54.511808  The second, and more fundamental, thing to understand about the mole is how it gets its specific value.  The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of pure C-12.  12 g C = 1 mol C atoms = 6.022×10^23 C atomsMole Conversions: Atoms to Moles or Moles to Atoms  Audio 0:28:02.694268  Converting between number of moles and number of atoms is similar to converting between dozens of eggs and number of eggs.

Most of the volume of the atom is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively charged electrons are dispersed.      There are many negatively charged electrons outside the nucleus as there are positively charged particles (named protons) within the nucleus, so that the atom is electrically neutral.      Protons (and Neutrons)  Audio 0:17:40.279234  Had bare proton (nucleus of hydrogen) Charge of alpha particle x 2 proton  Mass of alpha particle x 4 proton  So must be something else in the nucleus          Neutron      Chadwick’s Experiment (1932)  Audio 0:18:21.136318  The Atom’s Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:20:04.055851  All atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles:          Protons      Neutrons      Electrons        Protons and neutrons have nearly identical masses          The mass of the proton is 1.67262 * 10^-27 kg      The mass of the neutron is 1.67493 × 10^–27 kg.      The mass of the electron is 9.1 × 10^31 kg.        The charge of the proton and the charge of the electron are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. The neutron has no charge.Subatomic Particles  Audio 0:21:17.788117  Elements: Defined by Their Numbers of Protons  The most important number to the identity of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus.  The number of protons defines the element.  The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is itsatomic number and is given the symbol Z.Isotopes: Elements with Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:24:33.380011  All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; however, they do not necessarily have the same number of neutrons.          Example:                  All neon atoms contain 10 protons, but theymay contain 10, 11, or 12 neutrons.          All three types of neon atoms exist, and each has a slightly different mass.                                Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:26:45.772174  The sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is its mass number and is represented by the symbol A.    X is the chemical symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.Isotopes: Representation  Audio 0:28:13.708943  A second common notation for isotopes is the chemical symbol (or chemical name) followed by a dash and the mass number of the isotope.  Isotopes: Varied Number of Neutrons  Audio 0:28:56.545513  The relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a given element is roughly constant.  The percentages are called the natural abundance of the isotopes.  Clicker Question  Audio 0:32:59.698445  What is the atomic number (Z), mass number (A), of chlorine with 18 neutrons?  Z = 17, A = 35 (or 17 + 18)Ions: Charged Atoms Losing and Gaining Electrons  Audio 0:34:19.624557  The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus (designated by its atomic number Z).  In chemical changes, however, atoms can lose or gain electrons and become charged particles called ions.          Positively charged ions are called cations.                  Metal elements, such as Na+, form cations.                    Negatively charged ions are called anions.                  Nonmetal elements, such as F–, form anions.                    Atomic Mass: The Average Mass of an Element’s Atoms  Audio 0:36:03.449187  Atomic mass is sometimes called the atomic weight or standard atomic weight.  The atomic mass of each element is directly beneath the element’s symbol in the periodic table.  The atomic mass of an element represents the average mass of the isotopes that compose that element          It is a weighted value based on the element’s natural abundance of each isotope.

Democritus wrote, “Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.”                  He proposed that atoms existed in different shapes and sizes and moved randomly through empty space.                      Plato and Aristotle did not embrace the atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          They held that matter had no smallest parts.      They proposed that different substances were composed of various proportions of fire, air, earth, and water.      Early Building Blocks of Matter Ideas  Audio 0:24:38.965354  An English chemist, John Dalton (1766–1844) offered convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus.          Dalton’s atomic theory of matter        Modern Atomic Theory and Its Laws:          Law of conservation of mass      Law of definite proportions      Law of multiple proportions      John Dalton and the Atomic Theory  John Dalton and the Atomic Theory          Each element is composed of tiny indestructible particles called atoms.      All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements      Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds      Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, atoms change only the way that they are bound together with other atoms.      The Law of Conservation of Mass  Audio 0:27:20.929720  Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conservation of mass, which states the following:          In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.        When a chemical reaction occurs, the total mass of the substances involved in the reaction does not change.          This law is consistent with the idea that matter is composed of small, indestructible particles.        Audio 0:28:53.424491  The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:29:25.280225  In 1797 a French chemist named Joseph Proust made observations on the composition of compounds  He summarized his observations in the law of definite proportions:          All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent elements.        The law of definite proportions is sometimes called the law of constant composition.An Example of the Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:02.047142  The decomposition of 18.0 g of water (H2O) results in 16.0 g of oxygen (O2) and 2.0 g of hydrogen (H2)  an oxygen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 8:1.  Problem Solving: The Law of Definite Proportions  Audio 0:32:39.294000  Two samples of carbon dioxide decompose into their constituent elements. One produces 25.6 g oxygen and 9.60 g carbon, the other 21.6 g oxygen, and 8.10 g carbon. Show that these results are consistent with the law of definite proportions.The Law of Multiple Proportions  Audio 0:34:08.719405  In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions:          When two elements (call them A and B) form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine with 1 g of element A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.                  When an atom of A combines with either one, two, three, or more atoms of B, the following molecular compounds are possible: AB1, AB2, AB3, etc.                      Audio 0:36:00.257154  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are two compounds composed of the same two elements: carbon and oxygen.                The mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1; therefore, 2.67 g of oxygen reacts with 1 g of carbon.      In carbon monoxide, however, the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon is 1.33:1, or 1.33 g of oxygen to every 1 g of carbon.        The ratio of these two masses is itself a small whole number                Problem Solving: The Law of Multiple Proportions  Nitrogen forms a number of compounds with oxygen. Measurements of the masses of nitrogen and oxygen that form upon decomposing these compounds show that nitrogen dioxide contains 2.28 g oxygen to every 1.00 g of nitrogen, while dinitrogen monoxide contains 0.570 g oxygen to every 1.00 g nitrogen. Show that the results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions:                            4 is a small whole number which coincides with the law of multiple proportions                    The Structure of the AtomThe Discovery of the Electron  Audio 0:41:57.987686  From J. J. Thomson’s (1856–1940) cathode rays experiments, it was observed that          a beam of particles, called cathode rays, traveled from the negatively charged electrode (called the cathode) to the positively charged one (called the anode);      the particles that compose the cathode ray have the following properties:                  They travel in straight lines.          They are independent of the composition of the material from which they originate (the cathode).          They carry a negative electrical charge.                      J.J. Thomson was able to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles by deflecting them using electric and magnetic fields, as shown in the figure on the bottom of the next slide.          The value he measured was –1.76 × 103 coulombs per gram. © 2015 Pearson Education, Inc.

An element is a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.          Basic building blocks of matter      Composed of single type of atom, like helium        A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements in fixed definite proportions.  Most elements are chemically reactive and combine with other elements to form compounds.Heterogeneous Mixture  A heterogeneous mixture is one in which the composition varies from one region of the mixture to another.          Made of multiple substances, whose presence can be seen (example: a salt and sand mixture)                  Portions of a sample of a heterogeneous mixture have different composition and properties.                    Homogeneous Mixture  A homogeneous mixture is one made of multiple substances, but it appears to be one substance.  All portions of a sample have the same composition and properties (like sweetened tea).  Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Audio 0:12:42.707245  The approach to scientific knowledge is empirical  It is based on observation and experimentation.

They are the descriptions about the characteristics or behavior of nature.        Observations, verification of observations, and experimentation can lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis.The Scientific Approach to Knowledge  Scientists try to understand the universe through empirical knowledge gained through observation and experimentGathering Empirical Knowledge ─ Observation  Some observations are descriptions of the characteristics or behavior of nature ─ qualitative  Some observations compare a characteristic to a standard numerical scale ─ quantitativeFrom Observation to Understanding  Audio 0:15:58.585935  Hypothesis – a tentative interpretation or explanation for an observation  A good hypothesis is one that can be tested to be proved wrong!Testing Ideas  Audio 0:17:57.155168  Ideas in science are tested with experiments  An experiment is a set of highly controlled procedures designed to test whether an idea about nature is valid  The experiment generates observations that will either validate or invalidate the ideaIs this a good hypothesis?

Jombert, Paris (1997)        D’Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ….Unfortunately he carried [his]… pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong…          Thomas L. Hankins (1990). Jean D’Alembert: Science and the Enlightenment. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 236. ISBN 2881243991      Why Is Scientific Measurement Important?  Scientific data can be either qualifiable or quantifiable          Qualifiable data are observational                  Subjective in nature          Examples: color, shape                      Quantifiable data are measurable (empirical).

Although the atoms and molecules in a solidvibrate, they do not move around or pasteach other.  Consequently, a solid has a fixed volume andrigid shape.          Ice, aluminum, and diamond are good examplesof solids.      Liquid Matter  In liquid matter, atoms or molecules pack about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each other.  Liquids have fixed volume but not a fixed shape.  Liquids’ ability to flow makes them assume the shape of their container.          Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at room temperature.      Gaseous Matter  In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them.  They are free to move relative to one another.  Fill available space  These qualities make gases compressible.Classification of Matter by Components  Matter can be classified according to its composition: elements, compounds, and mixtures.  a pure substance is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant  a mixture is a substance composed of two or more components in proportions that can vary from one sample to another  Vocab            Term      Definition                  matter      anything that has mass and occupies space (e.g. has volume)              atoms      Basic submicroscopic particles that constitute the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter              molecules      Substances formed when two or more atoms come together (bond) in specific geometric arrangements              chemistry      a discipline that seeks to understand matter and its properties, and the transformations that matter undergoes- particularly between molecules              state      physical form of matter based on what properties it exhibits (i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.

Bakker E-mail: bakker@bama.ua.edu Phone: 348-9116Office:   1030 Shelby Hall   Office Hours:  Monday 5:00-6:00 pm, Thursdays 2-3 pm  and 4:00-5:00 pm. Others times by appointmentPrerequisitesMATH 100Course DescriptionThree lectures and one three-hour laboratory. Degree credit is not awarded for both CH 101 and CH 107 or for both CH 101 and CH 117. A survey of the fundamental facts, principles, and theories of general chemistry. Usually offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.Student Learning OutcomesThe objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles that form the foundations of chemistry.  An understanding of the quantum mechanical model of atoms provides the basis for understanding atomic structure, which in turn predicts the physical and chemical properties of atoms, as illustrated in the periodic table of the elements.  This understanding provides the basis for understanding the nature of chemical bonds: ionic and covalent.  An understanding of chemical bonds in turn provides the basis for predicting the structures of molecules, and a qualitative understanding of chemical reactions.  A quantitative understanding of the energy of atoms and molecules will provide the basis for predicting the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions and the accompanying release or absorption of heat.  The last objective is to be able to quantitatively predict the properties of gases and understand how the speed of molecular motion relates to the chemical and physical properties of gases and gas mixtures.Required Texts  TURNING TECH / NXT CLICKER (Required)  TRO (CUSTOM) / Chemistry: Structure and Properties Package for University of Alabama, 1/e (Required)Exams and AssignmentsExams 1 – 3 will be given on Wednesday September 7th, October 5th and November 9th from 6:30 - 7:50 PM 127 BiologyFinal Exam:  Monday.  December 5th, 2016 11:30 AM—2:00 PM 127 BiologyA. ExamsYou must bring your ACT card, driver’s license, or other photographic identification to all exams in order to receive a grade.  Students are strongly encouraged to take all regularly scheduled exams. However, should you have to miss one of these exams it will become your drop grade.  If you miss a second exam and can provide a written, reasonable excuse, you will be permitted to use your score (calculated as a percent) on the final exam as a makeup score for the test you missed.  No make-up exams will be given.  No programmable calculators, or calculators that solve polynomial equations, language translators, pagers, cell phones or similar electronic devices are allowed.B. QuizzesQuizzes will be given most every non-test week.  Electronic quizzes will be given either in the Wednesday afternoon recitation sessions or in the lecture classes using the Turning Point response units (“Clicker”).  The response units may be purchased in the SUPE Store (in the Ferguson Center).  It is your responsibility to make sure that your response unit is working, including its batteries, and you must bring it to every class meeting and recitation session.  Your lowest two or three quiz scores will be dropped, and the remainder will be used towards a maximum of 50 points; however, all quizzes will count toward your attendance points.  50% of a questions value will be attendance, 50% will be performance. No make-up quizzes will be given.C. HomeworkHomework assignments will be submitted on the Web using MyLabsPlus.  The due dates are listed on the Web site. Typically about 15-20 problems will be assigned per chapter for a total of approximately 150 questions for the semester.  Each assignment will carry equal weight.  The instructions for logging in are available on BlackBoard Learn. Each assignment carry equal weight. Please check your textbook package for extra instructions.Grading Policy            Assignment      Points                  Exam1      100              Exam2      100              Exam3      100              HW      50              Quizzes      50              In-Class      150              Lab      150              Final      700      Grading ScaleA = 90 – 100  B = 80 - 89   C = 70 -  79  D = 60 - 69  F &lt; 60Plus/Minus grading will be used.Policy on Missed Exams &amp; CourseworkExamsStudents are strongly encouraged to take all regularly scheduled exams. However, should you have to miss one of these exams it will become your drop grade.  If you miss a second exam and can provide a written, reasonable excuse, you will be permitted to use your score (calculated as a percent) on the final exam as a makeup score for the test you missed.  No make-up exams will be given.QuizzesAs there is a drop grade no make-up quizzes will be given.Outline of Topics  Liquids, Solids and Intermolecular Forces  Phase Diagrams and Crystalline Solids  Solutions  Chemical Kinetics  Chemical Equilibrium  Acids and Bases  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium  Free Energy and Thermodynamics  ElectrochemistryAttendance PolicyAttendance is mandatory and will be taken in all class periods with the use of the Turning Point Response Unit.  Your number of attendances will count towards a maximum of 50 points for in-class performance/participation.  50% of each question will count towards attendance and 50% towards performance. There will be 5 drops given for absences, and so documentation for excused absences will only be necessary in the case of extended absences.  You will need to go to Blackboard to enter your clicker ID number. Please ensure that you enter your name also so that you can earn credit for clicker usage."
